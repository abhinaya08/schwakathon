In its filing to Congress on Tuesday, Facebook Inc disclosed that it also spent more on government lobbying in 2018 than it ever had before at $12.62 million. That was up from $11.51 million a year ago, according to tracking by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Google\u2019s spent $18.04 million on lobbying in 2017, according to the center\u2019s data. Google and Facebook declined to comment beyond their filings. U.S. lawmakers and regulators have weighed new privacy and antitrust rules to rein in the power of large internet service providers such as Google, Facebook and Amazon.com Inc. Regulatory backlash in the United States, as well as Europe and Asia, is near the top of the list of concerns for technology investors, according to financial analysts. Microsoft Corp spent $9.52 million on lobbying in 2018, according to its disclosure on Tuesday, up from $8.5 million in 2017 but below its $10.5 million tab in 2013. Apple Inc  spent $6.62 million last year, compared to its record of $7.15 million in 2017, according to center data going back to 1998. Apple and Microsoft did not respond to requests to comment. A filing from Amazon was expected later on Tuesday. Google disclosed that new discussion topics with regulators in the fourth quarter included its search technology, criminal justice reform and international tax reform. The company is perennially among the top spenders on lobbying in Washington along with a few cable operators, defense contractors and healthcare firms. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, who testified in December before a U.S. House of Representatives panel for the first time, has said the company backs the idea of national privacy legislation. But he has contested accusations of the company having a political bias in its search results and of  stifling competition. Susan Molinari, Google\u2019s top U.S. public policy official, stepped down to take on an advisory role this month.

Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. \u201cIt should be an open process, because you can\u2019t have it all,\u201d Stamos said.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}

The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. \u201cThere is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\u201d a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. \u201cIf Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,\u201d Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an \u201cextreme remedy\u201d by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. \u201cMy fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.\u201d However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. \u201cIt should be an open process, because you can\u2019t have it all,\u201d Stamos said.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}
