In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time \"digesting\" the chips as they build out their centers.

{"author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "headline": "Cramer: Here are 7 shutdown-proof investing themes", "text": "This earnings season is far enough along that investors can start making judgments about which stock market sectors are on the rise and which ones could see weakness in the better part of 2019, says CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives\" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's \"ill-advised\" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of \"Mad Money,\" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: \"If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,\" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that \"the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,\" he said. \"Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much.\" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite \"because of the disruptive new aircraft engine.\" Still, \"the whole group is too low,\" he said. \"That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy.\" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, \"is starting to make an impact\" as well, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far \u2014 they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,\" Cramer said adding that Xilinx \"feels like the new Nvidia\" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. \"[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,\" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. \"Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,\" Cramer said. \"Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play.\" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. \"That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,\" he said. \"When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,\" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: \"Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague.\" \"These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,\" he said. \"I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's.\" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, \"only a couple\" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous \"sell\" button for \"everyone else\" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. \"There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,\" he noted. \"This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic \u2014 think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter.\" \"Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,\" Cramer said. \"Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Honeywell, Cisco Systems and Five Below.

The Making Money While I Sleep Portfolio's January buys are in. Owners of Target (TGT) stock have taken a beating as the merchandiser\u2019s shares have been whacked to the tune nearly 20% since mid November.Ouch.Shares first started to fall in early November, but things really got going when the retailer released its 11/20 earnings report which was\u2026 ummm\u2026 not well received. Shares fell 7% on the back of the report and have traded sideways since.Target is a blue chip company with a fantastic track record. When a stock like that takes a whack, it behooves investors to do some analysis. Is this company on sale, or is it stock on the receiving end of a well deserved valuation adjustment?Keeping an eye on beaten up blue chips has served me well, helping me get into Starbucks at a fantastic price. The trick, however, is to avoid the falling knife.I\u2019ll give you the short version: if you think Target is going to start growing, you should buy here. If not, stay away.Valuation and GrowthTarget trades at a PE ratio of 11.7. On the surface, this is an attractive number, but a key piece of any valuation is the company\u2019s expected future growth. It would seem Mr. Market is not impressed by Target\u2019s growth prospects.Is this fair?Well\u2026 yeah, if history is any guide. Target has spent the last five years providing shareholders with exactly what it is priced for: no meaningful growth in sales or earnings.Revenue has been stagnant at a little over $70 billion since 2013, and the lack of growth holds down to the bottom line. Just check out the two graphs from Target\u2019s 2017 annual report. Notice anything? And don\u2019t bother looking too hard.In fact, if I notice anything, it\u2019s the uncomfortable feeling I get in my stomach from eyeing these charts. The trend line is flat, the 5-year CAGR is negative, and none of these things make me feel happy thoughts as a potential investor.That is why Target trades at a depressed valuation multiple.The question becomes whether the multiple has been punished enough, and, more importantly, whether the company will be able to get the \u201cE\u201d portion moving in coming years. I\u2019m not interested in holding a growthless company for the long run, no matter how good the dividend or how low the PE ratio. If Target can return to growth, the market will sort out the rest.A lot has been written of Target\u2019s attempts to rejuvenate brands and improve the in store experience, and I\u2019m not going to dig into that here. The elephant in the room is the online retail space. Target would be just fine in a world without Amazon (AMZN). However, the threat is real, and Target has long been behind in the online weapons race, thousands of miles behind Amazon and well behind comparable retailer Walmart (WMT).E-commerceWhile starting from behind, Target isn\u2019t taking the e-commerce hits lying down.

The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added. \"I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,\" Swan said. \"But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been.

Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: \"If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,\" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that \"the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,\" he said. \"Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much.\" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite \"because of the disruptive new aircraft engine.\" Still, \"the whole group is too low,\" he said. \"That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy.\" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, \"is starting to make an impact\" as well, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far \u2014 they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,\" Cramer said adding that Xilinx \"feels like the new Nvidia\" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. \"[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,\" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. \"Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,\" Cramer said. \"Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play.\" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. \"That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,\" he said. \"When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,\" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: \"Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague.\" \"These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,\" he said. \"I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's.\" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, \"only a couple\" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous \"sell\" button for \"everyone else\" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. \"There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,\" he noted. \"This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic \u2014 think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter.\" \"Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,\" Cramer said. \"Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Honeywell, Cisco Systems and Five Below.
