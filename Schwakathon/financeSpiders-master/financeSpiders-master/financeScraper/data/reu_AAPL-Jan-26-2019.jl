The action by noyb, chaired by data privacy activist Max Schrems, also named Netflix ( ), Spotify ( ) and YouTube ( ), after it tested them by requesting private data the companies hold about the user. \u201cNo service fully complied,\u201d noyb said in its statement. The GDPR, implemented in May, gives users the right to access their data and information about the sources and recipients of the data. Social networks must regain Europeans\u2019 consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules. In response to the complaint, Amazon said it has introduced a new \u201cPrivacy Help\u201d page which shows customers how they can manage their information across its platforms. \u201cWe comply with any request from a data subject to provide access to the personal data that Amazon is processing,\u201d Amazon said on Friday. A spokeswoman for Spotify said: \u201cWe are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant.\u201d Noyb said it filed its complaints with the Austrian authority on behalf of 10 users. The Austrian watchdog would have to work with its counterparts at the streaming services\u2019 main establishments. \u201cMany services set up automated systems to respond to access requests, but they often don\u2019t even remotely provide the data that every user has a right to,\u201d Schrems said. \u201cThis leads to structural violations of users\u2019 rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information.\u201d Schrems is a veteran privacy campaigner who took his first legal action against Facebook ( ) as a student in 2011. Now a lawyer, Schrems filed complaints last year against Google, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they were acting illegally by forcing users to accept intrusive terms of service or lose access.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}

The new Honor View20, launched in China in December, was presented in Paris on Tuesday. The phone has a 48 mega pixel camera that can take several pictures at once and combine the best qualities from each in a single photo. It also has a second camera that can take 3D pictures and a 25 mega pixel in-screen front camera for selfies. The smartphone starts at 549 euros ($624). The appeal of Honor - a sub-brand in Huawei\u2019s smartphone portfolio - is that it has many of the advanced features of the company\u2019s premium line of Huawei-brand phones at significantly lower cost. \u201cThey\u2019re really trying to build up the brand in Europe,\u201d said Annette Zimmermann, an analyst at Gartner. She said Honor started as a cheaper alternative to Huawei\u2019s more expensive smartphones, but that the firm was now gradually increasing the prices for the Honor brand. Europe has become the second-biggest market for Huawei, making it a major region for further international expansion as the company also tries to bolster its presence in the United States. Huawei overtook Apple to become the world\u2019s second-biggest smartphone seller after Samsung last year. The Chinese company had a market share of 13.4 percent worldwide in the third quarter last year, compared with 18.9 percent for Samsung and 11.8 percent for Apple, according to Gartner.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}
