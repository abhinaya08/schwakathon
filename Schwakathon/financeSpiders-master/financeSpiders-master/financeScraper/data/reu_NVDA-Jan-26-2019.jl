Huang, speaking at an event in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, said XPeng and Singulato will use Nvidia\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) driving chip Xavier and its computing platform to develop hardware for autonomous driving, a strategic technology area in which China\u2019s leaders want to compete globally. The companies separately said they will work on a series of projects from data collection to machine learning. XPeng, in a statement, said it plans to implement level 3 intelligent driving features in its vehicles starting in 2020 using customized software and hardware developed with Nvidia and Huizhou Desay SV Automotive Co Ltd ( ). Level 3 in autonomous driving technology refers to drivers being able to turn their attention away from driving tasks but still requires them to respond immediately in some scenarios. Singulato said it will use Nvidia\u2019s Xavier platform to develop level 3 self-driving systems and eventually upgrade to level 4, in which vehicles are able to drive completely autonomously in most, but not all, conditions. SF Motors, based in Silicon Valley in the United States, said it plans to launch its first electric crossover vehicle next year, and will develop its next-generation autonomous platform using Xavier. Xavier is an artificial intelligence computing system-on-chip released by Nvidia earlier this year. Automakers using the chip can add specific software to adapt their vehicles to local traffic and infrastructure situations, Nvidia said.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}

Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon\u2019s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips. Amazon\u2019s so-called \u201cInferentia\u201d chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests. The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia\u2019s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer. Intel\u2019s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel. In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel\u2019s dominance in that market. Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google\u2019s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia. Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies. Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google\u2019s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization. Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia\u2019s chips, according to Google\u2019s website.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}

ZF is also offering for the first time the option of using a chip made by rival Xilinx Inc along with Nvidia. The level 2+ autonomous vehicles would add greater automation capabilities such as highway merge, lane change, lane splits and personal mapping to existing advanced driver assist systems (ADAS). Nvidia said the platform integrates its Xavier system-on-chip (SoC) processors and the Drive software to process data from sensors outside the vehicle and inside the cabin. Drive AutoPilot is part of the Nvidia Drive platform, currently being used by hundreds of companies involved in self-driving cars - including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Volkswagen AG ( ), and also by software developers, auto suppliers, sensor and mapping companies.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}

Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, during a keynote address at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, gave a preview of AMD\u2019s third-generation Ryzen CPU chips for desktop users. The Ryzen CPU chips will be launched in the middle of this year and will compete with Intel\u2019s PC processors. AMD will start shipping its Radeon VII (seven) graphics chips, which compete with Nvidia\u2019s gaming chips, from Feb. 7 and the next generation of EPYC server chips in mid-2019, Su said. All the three chips are based on AMD\u2019s partners\u2019 new 7nm manufacturing technology that packs more transistors on smaller chips and can boost performance at lower power. AMD\u2019s longtime manufacturing partner Global Foundries last year said it would quit trying to develop such advanced manufacturing techniques on its own, and AMD said it would move all of its 7-nanometer production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which analysts also believe is making 7nm chips for Apple Inc. AMD\u2019s EPYC server chips and the Ryzen CPU chips are based on Zen 2 architecture, an advancement over its Zen chips that was launched in 2017, establishing the chipmaker as an equal, if not better than Intel in terms of chip performance, according to many tech websites. For Intel, which has faced production delays for its 10nm-based chips, this could mean a loss of market share to AMD, analysts have said. Intel has said it expects to ship 10nm PC chips later this year and 10nm server chips early next year. During the keynote, Su showed that Ryzen III consumed 30 percent less power than Intel\u2019s Core i9 CPU chip. Intel, the world\u2019s biggest maker of computing chips for personal computers and data centers, has been a leader in manufacturing the tiniest chips so far but recently lost its title to Taiwan Semiconductor. Su also announced that Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google was partnering to use AMD\u2019s Radeon graphics chips on its recently announced video game streaming service, Project Stream.", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/"}
