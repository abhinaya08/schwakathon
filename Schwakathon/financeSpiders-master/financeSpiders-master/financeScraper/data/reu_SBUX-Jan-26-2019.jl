The 30,000-square-foot caffeinated wonderland represents just one of 6,000, mostly smaller stores the chain plans to roll out across the mainland by 2022. Such bold plans will run up against stiffer competition and trade-war-related pressures in 2019. Local backers will help preserve this fledgling Bean Dynasty. Cracking China has been tough for outsiders, including in fast food. McDonald\u2019s sold a controlling stake in its Greater China restaurants to state-owned conglomerate CITIC in 2017. And as part of a wholesale spinoff of Yum China, the U.S. parent of KFC and Taco Bell offloaded a slug of the operation to Fred Hu\u2019s Primavera Capital and Jack Ma\u2019s Ant Financial. For now, Starbucks is touting its independent growth ambitions in the People\u2019s Republic. At a full-day presentation focused on the country in May, it forecast tripling revenue there in five years. The company doesn\u2019t break out China figures, but Morningstar estimates by then the top line would reach $6 billion, generating some $1.2 billion in operating profit, or nearly a fifth of the total for both. Investors don\u2019t yet seem convinced. As of mid-December, Starbucks was trading at almost 24 times anticipated earnings for the next 12 months, a discount to recent historical levels. And the hefty premium it has fetched over the Golden Arches for much of the last decade has mostly vanished. That suggests Chief Executive Kevin Johnson isn\u2019t getting credit for his great leap into China. There are valid reasons to be sceptical. Homegrown startups such as Luckin Coffee are expanding rapidly with the help of deep-pocketed backers. American brands are also in perpetual danger of getting swept up by geopolitical headwinds. Mergers have been caught in the crossfire, and targeted economic retaliation is a weapon China has used before. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz\u2019s dream of becoming U.S. president remains a distant hedge. Stronger financial ties with well-connected allies, beyond just collaborations like the one with Alibaba for deliveries, could provide some insurance, as well as useful local knowhow as Starbucks extends deeper into the country. It recently bought out its Taiwanese partners in an East China joint venture, clearing the way for a venti-size deal to start brewing. - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019.

The firm, which only officially launched its business at the start of last year, has expanded at breakneck speed, propelled by a focus on technology, delivery, and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses. \u201cWhat we want at the moment is scale and speed,\u201d Luckin\u2019s chief marketing officer, Yang Fei, told reporters on Thursday at a presentation in Beijing. \u201cThere\u2019s no point talking about profit,\u201d he said, adding that subsidies to lure in more users would be an important part of the firm\u2019s strategy for the next few years. Luckin said it was targeting a total of more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, which would take it past Seattle-based Starbucks that has long dominated China\u2019s coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country. Luckin\u2019s caffeine-fuelled expansion is in stark contrast to Starbucks, which opened its first China store in 1999 and has spent two decades reaching its current store count. The U.S. chain, which spearheaded the growth of a coffee culture in China, started to see competition rise from smaller peers over the last 18 months, though Luckin has stood out as the most aggressive competitor. But Luckin\u2019s rise has not come cheaply. The firm recorded a loss of 800 million yuan ($116.34 million) last year, which its chief marketing officer said was in line with expectations as it pushed to expand.

The world\u2019s largest coffee chain said it listened to customers and brought back its much loved red-colored cups and holiday favorites such as Peppermint Mochas and Gingerbread Lattes during the final three months of 2018. \u201cThis comprehensive, insight-driven approach delivered results and importantly, created momentum that provides a solid foundation for future quarters,\u201d Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said on a conference call with analysts. The Seattle-headquartered company, which is battling high-end coffee houses and smaller upstarts in the United States, has rolled out promotions, especially during slow afternoons to pull in more customers. Iced beverages and its Draft Nitro cold brew which aims to create a beer-like experience have been particularly successful, and the company said its morning and afternoon sales in the December-quarter was the best in five quarters. Partnerships with food-delivery companies and an increased focus on customer service through its mobile app are also helping boost sales, Starbucks executives said. Globally, the company\u2019s same-restaurant sales rose 4 percent during the December-quarter, topping analysts\u2019 average estimate of a 2.8 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. \u201cOverall, we believe it was a solid quarter and this is another quarter that reinforces our view that the turnaround is showing progress and gaining some steam,\u201d Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Sales from Starbucks\u2019 Americas and U.S. business reached a record $4.6 billion in the three months ended Dec. 30, while same-restaurant sales in China, its second biggest market, also showed an increase. In China, where the company competes with local brands like Luckin Coffee, sales at established Starbucks cafes beat estimates, driven mainly by new store openings and its delivery program that now supports 2,000 stores across 30 Chinese cities.
