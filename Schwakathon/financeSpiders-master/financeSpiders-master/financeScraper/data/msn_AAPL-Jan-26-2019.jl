{"author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "headline": "Cramer Remix: WWE's subscription service has others following its lead", "text": "Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on \"Mad Money.\" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming \u2014 think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku \u2014 are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,\" Cramer told viewers. \"World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps.\" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. \"She can have that opinion,\" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on \"Mad Money.\" \"I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.\"  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication \"in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.\"  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's \"earnings Super Bowl,\" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. \"It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,\" he said. \"Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype.\" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. \"In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,\" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is \"flirting with 3 percent,\" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. \"We can afford to wait this out. They can't,\" he said. \"So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: \"I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need.\" E-Trade Financial Corp.: \"I think it's good. I do lament \u2013 I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook.

{"author": "CNBC", "headline": "CNBC: APPLE JUST DISMISSED MORE THAN 200 EMPLOYEES FROM PROJECT TITAN, ITS AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE GROUP", "text": "Lora Kolodny, Christina Farr, Paul A. Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: \"We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,\" the spokesperson said. \"We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever.\" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. \"I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,\" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

{"author": "Shreyashi   Sanyal", "headline": "US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher", "text": "(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings \"that for the most part are beating expectations\" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. \"Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,\" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. \"That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,\" he argued, adding that \"the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower.\" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

{"author": "Sara Salinas", "headline": "Apple shares rally, erase losses from revenue warning this month", "text": "Apple shares rose more than 3 percent on Friday, gaining enough ground to practically erase the losses that followed the company's lowered revenue guidance three weeks ago. The stock traded as high as $158.13, briefly topping the $157.92 closing price on Jan. 2. After the market's close that day, Apple said sales for its fiscal first quarter would likely fall short of expectations due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and headwinds in China. Apple lost 10 percent of its market value the day after the announcement, marking the stock's steepest one-day drop since 2013. Shares closed at $157.76 Friday.  Even with the recent bounce, it's been a particularly rough few months for Apple investors.

{"author": "Patti Domm", "headline": "Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings", "text": "The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks \u2014 Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth \u2014 but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. \"They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat \u2014 at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. \"This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,\" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. \"In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,\" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. \"I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,\" she said. \"In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.\" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. \"When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,\" Calvasina said. \"Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.\" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.\"The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,\" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. \"We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,\" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize.\" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, \"this stock could fly,\" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for \"shooting itself in the foot.\" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant \"one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,\" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. \"This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,\" he noted. \"I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock.\" Pfizer: The \"Mad Money\" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. \"It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,\" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   \"I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,\" Cramer warned. \"That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back.\" But, he admitted, \"I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday].\" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: \"The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around.\" AT&amp;T: The \"Mad Money\" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. \"If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,\" Cramer said. \"He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings \u2014 that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful.\" Tesla: \"A boatload of controversy\" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. \"My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,\" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less \"inured to negativity at this point,\" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,\" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has \"been on fire of late,\" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a \"crowded\" day. \"We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,\" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. \"The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,\" he said. \"Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more.\" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a \"quandary\" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was \"getting too much advance attention from the bulls.\" The Amazon zealots are \"starting to squawk about an upside surprise,\" he said. \"That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it.\" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The \"remarkable rebound\" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. \"I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,\" he said. The \"Mad Money\" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. \"I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,\" he acknowledged. \"You've got the highlights, though.

That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a \"poster child for the pain of cord-cutting\" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. \"And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,\" Cramer said. \"In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,\" he continued. \"The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting.\" The \"Mad Money\" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. \"Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,\" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally \"too small to move the needle,\" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a \"dark horse\" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. \"You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,\" he said.

Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. \"In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,\" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is \"flirting with 3 percent,\" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. \"We can afford to wait this out. They can't,\" he said. \"So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: \"I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen.

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: \"We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,\" the spokesperson said. \"We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever.\" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. \"I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,\" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. \u2014 CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

(NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha", "author": "Stone Fox Capital", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc", "text": "SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by \"excessive\" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the \"no license, no chips\" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge \"fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory\" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: \"Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'\" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm\u2019s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It\u2019s hard to understand the FTC\u2019s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm\u2019s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings \"that for the most part are beating expectations\" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. \"Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,\" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. \"That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,\" he argued, adding that \"the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower.\" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks \u2014 Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth \u2014 but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. \"They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat \u2014 at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. \"This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,\" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. \"In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,\" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. \"I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,\" she said. \"In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.\" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. \"When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,\" Calvasina said. \"Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.\" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.\"The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,\" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. \"We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,\" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize.\" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, \"this stock could fly,\" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for \"shooting itself in the foot.\" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant \"one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,\" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. \"This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,\" he noted. \"I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock.\" Pfizer: The \"Mad Money\" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. \"It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,\" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   \"I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,\" Cramer warned. \"That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back.\" But, he admitted, \"I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday].\" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: \"The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around.\" AT&amp;T: The \"Mad Money\" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. \"If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,\" Cramer said. \"He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings \u2014 that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful.\" Tesla: \"A boatload of controversy\" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. \"My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,\" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less \"inured to negativity at this point,\" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,\" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has \"been on fire of late,\" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a \"crowded\" day. \"We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,\" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. \"The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,\" he said. \"Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more.\" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a \"quandary\" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was \"getting too much advance attention from the bulls.\" The Amazon zealots are \"starting to squawk about an upside surprise,\" he said. \"That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it.\" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The \"remarkable rebound\" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. \"I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,\" he said. The \"Mad Money\" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. \"I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,\" he acknowledged. \"You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}
{"tick": "AAPL", "headline": "Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services", "author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html", "text": "Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on \"Mad Money.\" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming \u2014 think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku \u2014 are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a \"poster child for the pain of cord-cutting\" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. \"And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,\" Cramer said. \"In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,\" he continued. \"The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting.\" The \"Mad Money\" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. \"Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,\" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally \"too small to move the needle,\" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a \"dark horse\" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. \"You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,\" he said. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Additionally, Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast and Disney.
