The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens \"does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic.\" Glass Lewis in its analysis said a \"more thorough discussion is warranted at this time.\" They cite the immediate financial and legal risks to the company, as well as the additional threats. Walgreens owns about one-fourth of AmerisourceBergen, which is also embroiled in opioid litigation.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of medical products and pharmaceuticals. JNJ is a conservative investment that should be in all portfolios, being defensive when the market and economy are weak. The 57th dividend increase in a row is estimated to be in April 2019 from 0.90/Qtr to 0.97/Qtr or a 7% increase. One thing I think that is keeping JNJ down is the lawsuits concerning asbestos in their talcum powder. This is over-done, giving us a chance to buy JNJ at a fair price. Tests have shown that there is not any asbestos in the baby talcum powder, and all cases so far have been overturned on appeal. Johnson &amp; Johnson is 8.1% of The Good Business Portfolio. The company has steady growth and has plenty of cash it uses to buy bolt-on companies, develop new drugs, and increase the dividend each year.When I scanned the five-year chart, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a good chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for three of the five years with a pause in 2015 and 2018 when the market was a bit negative. Data by YChartsFundamentals of Johnson &amp; Johnson will be reviewed on the following topics below: The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines Total Return and Yearly Dividend Last Quarter's Earnings Company Business Takeaways Recent Portfolio Changes I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article \" The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018\". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Good Business Portfolio GuidelinesJohnson &amp; Johnson passes 9 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a fair score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below: Johnson &amp; Johnson does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield, with 56 years of increasing dividends and a 2.8% yield. Johnson &amp; Johnson is, therefore, a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate at 51%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for investment in expanding the business by buying bolt-on companies and increasing the dividend. I have a capitalization guideline where the capitalization must be greater than $10 Billion. JNJ easily passes this guideline. JNJ is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $345 Billion. Johnson &amp; Johnson's 2019 projected cash flow at $21 Billion is good, allowing the company to have the means for company growth and increasing the dividend for the 57th year in a row April 2019. I also require the S&amp;P CFRA CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses and my RMD with a CAGR of 7%. My dividends provide 3.3% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.2% plus an inflation cushion of 1.8%. The one-year forward CAGR of 6.0% does not meet my guideline requirement, but I believe the pharmaceutical group will outperform and raise this CAGR. The good future growth for Johnson &amp; Johnson can continue its uptrend benefiting from the continued growth of pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign countries. My total return guideline is that total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. JNJ slightly fails this guideline since the total return is 35.43%, less than the Dow's total return of 37.67%. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $15,800 today. This makes Johnson &amp; Johnson a fair investment for the total return investor looking back, that has future growth as the economy continues to grow, and more medical products are needed, and the talc headwind dissipates. One of my guidelines is that the S&amp;P rating must be three stars or better. JNJ's S&amp;P CFRA rating is three stars or hold with a target price of $137, passing the guideline. JNJ's price is presently 5% below the one year target. JNJ is under the target price at present and has a low PE of 16, making JNJ a good buy at this entry point. One thing I think that is keeping JNJ down are the lawsuits concerning asbestos in their baby talcum powder. This is over-done giving us a chance to buy JNJ at a fair price. Scientific tests have shown that there is not any asbestos in the baby talcum powder and all cases so far that have completed the appeal process have been overturned. There is still one large case for 22 women that are still in the appeal process. Take advantage of this valuation and buy this high-quality defensive business. One of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is yes. The total return is fair, and an above-average yield makes JNJ a good business to own for income and growth long term. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business and also generates a fair income stream. Most of all what makes JNJ interesting is the potential long-term growth as the economy and population grow, giving you an increasing dividend for the dividend growth investor with a defensive business.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

Attorneys general of 46 U.S. states announced the settlement agreement in statements on Tuesday. They alleged DePuy engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the promotion of its ASR XL and Pinnacle Ultamet hip implant devices. DePuy in a statement said the settlement involves no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. \"DePuy Synthes remains committed to meeting the current and future needs of orthopedic surgeons and patients,\" the company said. The states claimed J&amp;J made misleading claims about the longevity of its metal-on-metal hip implants, with patients frequently having to undergo a revision surgery before the company's advertised timeframe of five years. Under Tuesday's settlement agreement, DePuy is required to maintain a post-market surveillance program and update procedures to track complaints over the hip implants, according to a statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. DePuy in 2010 announced a worldwide voluntary recall of 93,000 of its ASR hip implant systems, saying that 12 percent of them failed within five years. Saying it would pay at least $2.47 billion, the company has since settled thousands of lawsuits by patients who had to have the ASR implant removed. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have also come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. The company faces some 10,400 lawsuits in the United States over its Pinnacle device in connection with those claims.

Click here to find out more \u00bbInvestment ThesisWith annual spend in the US alone in the range of $25-85B for products and services (depending on how you calculate it), the advanced wound care segment is poised to explode further. Although performance of the big, traditional players in this space may not always outperform the healthcare/medtech sectors overall, there exist many creative, fast-moving, and indirect plays that make this one of the most attractive segments for investment.IntroductionIn addition to the diverse causes of wounds (trauma, surgery, poor circulation, skin conditions, etc.), a plethora of projected global demographic and epidemiological trends contribute to wounds that are difficult to heal, including: Aging populations, cardiovascular disease (heart, arteries, veins), renal (kidney) disease, diabetes and other endocrinology-related disease, oncological (cancer) disease, rheumatological disease, dermatological issues, obesity and malnutrition, immobility and sedentary lifestyles, immune system compromise, chronic pain, medication side effects, and hundreds of other health conditions related to infection, hereditary, environmental, psycho-social, and other factors. The prevalence and projected growth of these conditions drive a large, unmet demand for advanced wound care that make for an attractive investment opportunity. Yet at this time, there are multiple areas where the deployment of capital to this space is greatly under the current and future potential.This article is primarily intended for healthcare, medtech, and related services and technology investors who seek to either explore advanced wound care opportunities, or to refine assumptions and investment theses.What exactly is advanced wound care?The first key to successful wound care investing is to wrap your head around the core concept of \"what is advanced wound care?\" Healthcare executives and investors who are not strictly focused on wound care are certainly reading this article. Many are already exposed to this space (whether they know it or not). Unfortunately, many damaging wound care due diligence and investment choices are related to a fundamental misunderstanding of what even makes up the segment.Following that initial misstep, even highly intelligent, thorough, and experienced business people have a higher chance of running into major problems that could have been avoided. Before anything else, a solid advanced wound care investment foundation depends on correctly grasping these four core concepts on at least a practical level: The phases of wound healing The difference between simple vs. advanced wounds Local vs. systemic problems with healing A working definition of advanced wound care Finally, we\u2019ll apply that foundation by exploring common investment mistakes made by both rookie and experienced advanced wound care investors alike.So here we go\u2026The phases of wound healing and \"simple\" vs. \"advanced\" woundsLet us suppose a healthy person accidentally cuts his finger while cooking. Assuming the wound is not large, the knife was clean and not rusty, and no major surprises (like slicing an artery), the wound is likely to close on its own. If so, can classify the above example as a \"simple wound\" because we neither expected nor experienced any healing complications making healing take longer than expected.On a very basic and practical level, there are four (or five) overlapping phases of wound healing: Hemostasis - a blood clot forms to stop bleeding, prevent further damage/contamination, and sends signals to trigger the next phases of the healing cascade. Inflammation - increased blood flow; removal of debris and neutralization of bacteria that may have entered the wound. Proliferation - (Often categorized as two separate phases, granulation and epithelialization), where the wound and skin fill in; when this is complete, most clinicians (including for clinical trial endpoints) refer to a wound as \"healed,\" even though there is technically one more phase... Remodeling - (Also referred to as maturation), where the underlying cells continue to restructure and strengthen over time (months or years).", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

Cramer specifically flagged the stock of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which he suspected under-promised in its lower-than-anticipated sales forecast for 2019. Shares of the pharmaceutical company ended the trading day 1.45 percent lower, roughly $10 above the stock's 52-week low. Still, Cramer understood investors' dilemma. The International Monetary Fund just slashed its global growth forecast for the next two years, and with a stronger U.S. dollar and a \"tight-fisted\" Federal Reserve, domestic and international U.S. companies are having trouble painting a good picture of the near term for investors, he explained. \"How can the CEO of an industrial company tell a good story when the global economy is indeed slowing?\" he said. \"How can executives go out and tell us not to worry when even Johnson &amp; Johnson sounded a little worried?\" Cramer predicted that this kind of action will lead to \"a rush of traders trying to take profits\" under the assumption that the market will retest, or fall back to, its recent lows as the Fed's potential interest rate increases and a U.S.-China trade talk breakdown remain as risk factors. He added that he doubted the \"retest theory\" would play out. \"In this environment, ... you may want to wait before you buy anything other than the stocks of companies that have already reported much better-than-expected quarters now that they're coming back to earth,\" he said. \"We have had a huge run here off the bottom, ... so it's natural that money managers will want to take something off the table.\" For the \"Mad Money\" host, the key to investing in this stock market is knowing your portfolio back and forth and being able to think on your feet. \"To me, this is one of those moments where you have to figure out if you can thread the needle. Are you nimble enough to sell now and buy back a few percentage points lower?\" he said. \"If so, go ahead. You have my blessing. But if you don't believe you can swap out and then swap back in a little bit lower, I think it's OK to wait patiently here and then do some buying at lower levels.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer.\" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care \u2014 as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company \u2014 Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. \"I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,\" he said. \"Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice.\" The \"Mad Money\" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that \"Apple's not a Facebook in disguise\" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. \"Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,\" he explained. \"[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch \u2014 that's the opportunity.\" He added that integrating Epic \u2014 another sore point among the Twitterati \u2014 would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? \"Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost.\" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: \"If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so.\" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of \"ideal\" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. \"One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic \u2014 yes, if Judy would sell \u2014 or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,\" he said. \"There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Facebook.

The turn of the calendar to the new year is a good time to reflect on the previous year to see how things change. I take the time to look back on the year that was to see how my dividend growth portfolio performed. Not from a return perspective, rather from a purely dividend growth perspective. Since my goal is to build up a portfolio of excellent companies that pay me cold, hard cash in the form of dividends, to support our lifestyle it's the dividends that are the most important part of the portfolio, with capital appreciation taking the backseat. The thing is, dividends are much steadier and more predictable than capital appreciation for any given year. Most of the companies I own increased their dividend at some point during 2018; however, the manic/depressive Mr. Market changed his tune multiple times throughout the year.That's why I want to focus on the dividends that my investments pay me each year and how much they grow each year.Forward Dividends by SectorMy forward dividends for the companies owned in my FI Portfolio ended 2018 at $6,250.78. The following chart shows the breakdown of my forward dividends by their primary sector.By sector, the two largest contributors are consumer discretionary and consumer staples at 21% and 18%, respectively. I'd like to get my consumer staples exposure a bit higher; however, I'm in no rush to do so if the valuation doesn't make sense. Energy is the next largest sector and is forecast to provide 13% of my dividends currently. During 2017's check up, I discussed wanting to reduce my weighting there to the 8-10% range, and well, it stayed the exact same as last year. Looking at the rest of the weightings, there isn't anything that really stands out as needing to be addressed other than health care and possibly the industrials. My target for both would be somewhere closer to the 8-10% range. Industrials were previously weighted closer to that until I closed out my position in Emerson Electric (EMR) in December. Utilities could probably also stand to be boosted up to somewhere in the 5-8% range.Dividend ClubsBack in mid-2015, I wrote about the Dividend Clubs, where each club was a different level of forward dividends. In order to join one of the Dividend Clubs, a holding has to meet the minimum amount of forward dividends for that specific club. So, in order to join the $50 club, a holding has to pay $50 or more in dividends.Think of it as one of those big, multi-room night clubs where there's a hip-hop room, an '80s room, a dance/techno room, a country room, etc. Except, instead of being able to go to each room, the $50 Club members can only stay in the $50 Club, whereas the $100 Club members get to experience the $50 Club and the $100 Club, and so on and so on. The $50 Club increased by 3 compared to the end of 2017 and now sits at 38 members. Sixteen of those holdings are currently stuck in the $50 Club until further notice.The $100 Club lost 1 member over the year as I did some cleaning up of the portfolio in late 2018. Eleven of the $100 Club members max out at the $100 level.The $200 Club grew by 1 member with PepsiCo (PEP) joining the ranks, thanks to a monster dividend increase last year.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens \"does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic.\" Glass Lewis in its analysis said a \"more thorough discussion is warranted at this time.\" They cite the immediate financial and legal risks to the company, as well as the additional threats.

Cramer specifically flagged the stock of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which he suspected under-promised in its lower-than-anticipated sales forecast for 2019. Shares of the pharmaceutical company ended the trading day 1.45 percent lower, roughly $10 above the stock's 52-week low. Still, Cramer understood investors' dilemma. The International Monetary Fund just slashed its global growth forecast for the next two years, and with a stronger U.S. dollar and a \"tight-fisted\" Federal Reserve, domestic and international U.S. companies are having trouble painting a good picture of the near term for investors, he explained. \"How can the CEO of an industrial company tell a good story when the global economy is indeed slowing?\" he said. \"How can executives go out and tell us not to worry when even Johnson &amp; Johnson sounded a little worried?\" Cramer predicted that this kind of action will lead to \"a rush of traders trying to take profits\" under the assumption that the market will retest, or fall back to, its recent lows as the Fed's potential interest rate increases and a U.S.-China trade talk breakdown remain as risk factors. He added that he doubted the \"retest theory\" would play out. \"In this environment, ... you may want to wait before you buy anything other than the stocks of companies that have already reported much better-than-expected quarters now that they're coming back to earth,\" he said. \"We have had a huge run here off the bottom, ... so it's natural that money managers will want to take something off the table.\" For the \"Mad Money\" host, the key to investing in this stock market is knowing your portfolio back and forth and being able to think on your feet. \"To me, this is one of those moments where you have to figure out if you can thread the needle. Are you nimble enough to sell now and buy back a few percentage points lower?\" he said. \"If so, go ahead. You have my blessing. But if you don't believe you can swap out and then swap back in a little bit lower, I think it's OK to wait patiently here and then do some buying at lower levels.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer.\" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care \u2014 as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company \u2014 Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. \"I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,\" he said. \"Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice.\" The \"Mad Money\" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that \"Apple's not a Facebook in disguise\" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. \"Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,\" he explained. \"[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch \u2014 that's the opportunity.\" He added that integrating Epic \u2014 another sore point among the Twitterati \u2014 would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? \"Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost.\" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: \"If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so.\" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of \"ideal\" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. \"One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic \u2014 yes, if Judy would sell \u2014 or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,\" he said. \"There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Facebook.

The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens \"does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic.\" Glass Lewis in its analysis said a \"more thorough discussion is warranted at this time.\" They cite the immediate financial and legal risks to the company, as well as the additional threats. Walgreens owns about one-fourth of AmerisourceBergen, which is also embroiled in opioid litigation.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

Cramer specifically flagged the stock of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which he suspected under-promised in its lower-than-anticipated sales forecast for 2019. Shares of the pharmaceutical company ended the trading day 1.45 percent lower, roughly $10 above the stock's 52-week low. Still, Cramer understood investors' dilemma. The International Monetary Fund just slashed its global growth forecast for the next two years, and with a stronger U.S. dollar and a \"tight-fisted\" Federal Reserve, domestic and international U.S. companies are having trouble painting a good picture of the near term for investors, he explained. \"How can the CEO of an industrial company tell a good story when the global economy is indeed slowing?\" he said. \"How can executives go out and tell us not to worry when even Johnson &amp; Johnson sounded a little worried?\" Cramer predicted that this kind of action will lead to \"a rush of traders trying to take profits\" under the assumption that the market will retest, or fall back to, its recent lows as the Fed's potential interest rate increases and a U.S.-China trade talk breakdown remain as risk factors. He added that he doubted the \"retest theory\" would play out. \"In this environment, ... you may want to wait before you buy anything other than the stocks of companies that have already reported much better-than-expected quarters now that they're coming back to earth,\" he said. \"We have had a huge run here off the bottom, ... so it's natural that money managers will want to take something off the table.\" For the \"Mad Money\" host, the key to investing in this stock market is knowing your portfolio back and forth and being able to think on your feet. \"To me, this is one of those moments where you have to figure out if you can thread the needle. Are you nimble enough to sell now and buy back a few percentage points lower?\" he said. \"If so, go ahead. You have my blessing. But if you don't believe you can swap out and then swap back in a little bit lower, I think it's OK to wait patiently here and then do some buying at lower levels.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson.

The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer.\" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care \u2014 as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company \u2014 Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. \"I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,\" he said. \"Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice.\" The \"Mad Money\" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that \"Apple's not a Facebook in disguise\" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. \"Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,\" he explained. \"[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch \u2014 that's the opportunity.\" He added that integrating Epic \u2014 another sore point among the Twitterati \u2014 would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? \"Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost.\" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: \"If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so.\" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of \"ideal\" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. \"One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic \u2014 yes, if Judy would sell \u2014 or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,\" he said. \"There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Facebook.
