{"author": "Thomas Franck", "headline": "Top weed analyst on Wall Street raises sales forecast, names top picks", "text": "Wall Street's top cannabis analyst believes U.S. sales of marijuana will rise more than she previously projected to $80 billion by 2030 and told clients to expect major Canadian growers Canopy Growth and Tilray to outperform in 2019. \"We expect continued growth in newly established U.S. states, and more robust growth in Canada as more supply comes online and new form factors hit the market,\" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Tuesday. \"Given our outlook for continued strong growth in North American cannabis in 2019, we remain constructive on all three of our publicly traded cannabis stocks,\" including Canopy, Tilray and KushCo, an American company that sells packaging for the cannabis industry. Azer is a widely followed analyst of the industry and one of the few from a major firm which covers the industry. Her previous forecast for U.S. cannabis sales by 2030 was $75 billion. After months of political haggling and legal debate, Canada became the first Group of Seven country to OK recreational use of pot on Oct. 17. But despite the excitement surrounding national legalization, Azer said that the adult-use market got off to a rocky start thanks to a rushed retail framework (e.g., no stores in Ontario) and insufficient supply available. Still, as Canadian legislatures gradually legalize new forms of cannabis consumption, planned production expansion should be enough to ease those early concerns. \"With the market set to expand to include novel form factors, and with expanded retail access, we remain encouraged at the market's potential for growth in 2019, where we expect adult use sales (at retail) to total C$3.1 billion (including taxes),\" Azer said. Specifically, Tilray and Canopy Growth should finally start to see the positive effect the adult use market will have on sales. Reported revenue at both companies may have disappointed some investors when Canopy and Tilray posted quarterly results last fall, though the true impact of the legalization was not reflected in those results. Though shares of both Tilray and Canopy are up in 2019, the stocks are off by more than 40 percent over the last three months. Azer expects a \"material increase\" in revenue at Canopy throughout 2019 as supply challenges are addressed. The analysts sees sales jumping from C$239 million in fiscal 2019 to C$778 million in fiscal 2020, a 225 percent rally. \"We remain confident in Canopy's ability to generate such vibrant sequential growth based on the company's seemingly leading share in the market,\" Azer wrote. Based on her e-commerce analysis, the Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company has a leading 18 percent share of all available units in the market. Things are looking up for Tilray, too, including the company's recently expanded relationship with Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis). CEO Brendan Kennedy said in a December statement that the \"agreement represents a major milestone in the movement to provide access to safe, GMP-certified medical cannabis to patients in need across the world.\" The company plans to work with Sandoz to supply nonsmokable and noncombustible medical cannabis products where it is legally allowed. Tilray has also said it would partner with global beer giant ABU in Canada, pushing Cowen's revenue estimate to C$120 million in calendar 2019. \"We continue to view the international medical market as one of the primary investment highlights for Tilray, which currently operates in 12 countries,\" Azer wrote. Its \"expanded partnership with Sandoz can help expand reach with pharmacists, physicians and distributors in Tilray's markets, while capturing early share in new medical cannabis markets as they come online.\"  While cannabis in the United States remains federally illegal, the U.S. market opportunity is quite sizable, according to Azer, with the current illicit market valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion and expected to flourish over the next decade. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents now support legalizing marijuana, according to the latest Gallup poll. That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. Cannabis represents a \"opportunity\" for big tobacco as more and more U.S. states join those that have already OK'd the adult recreational use of cannabis. Cowen looks to North Dakota, Louisiana and West Virginia to come online and highlights Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania as additional key states to watch. \"After passage of the Farm Bill, CBD will clearly be one of the most topical areas within cannabis over the coming year,\" Azer wrote. \"We expect the category could generate $1.6 billion in revenues over the next year or two, depending on the timing of FDA commentary and the pace of retail acceptance.\" The $867 billion farm bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, includes a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had introduced. The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government's list of controlled substances, making it a lawful agricultural commodity. In response to the passage of the farm bill, Canopy CEO Bruce Linton told CNBC that it represents a key \"first step\" toward the company's expansion into the U.S. market. The Food and Drug Administration later said that it is looking for \"pathways\" to legalize the sale of CBD oil and other cannabis-based compounds in food and beverages in a move that could remove one of the last remaining legal hurdles for companies hoping to sell such products across state lines.

{"author": "Angelica LaVito", "headline": "Juul combats criticism with ad campaign of smokers switching to e-cigs", "text": "Juul, the e-cigarette company that has become ubiquitous among teens, is launching its first television ad campaign targeting adult smokers as it faces criticism that its fruity flavors are designed for underaged users. The San Francisco-based e-cigarette company plans to launch over the summer its new TV campaign, featuring testimonials from adults who have used Juul to stop smoking cigarettes, executives said. The ads are likely to draw some controversy. Tobacco companies have long been restricted from most TV or print advertising, with marketing regulations stretching back to the 1970s. Federal and state regulators haven't yet applied the same standards to e-cigarettes, which are a relatively new product. Juul will initially spend almost $10 million for TV slots airing on national cable channels after 10 p.m. local time. The ads, a series of three different commercials, are aimed at adults 35 years and older, executives said. The 60-second spots feature three former smokers between the ages of 37 and 54 who talk about their experience with cigarettes, including how smoking strained relationships or isolated them from families and friends, and how Juul helped them quit smoking. The campaign marks the start of a year Juul will need to spend proving to regulators its product is ending up where its supposed to \u2014 in the hands of adult smokers, not teenagers. And fresh with nearly $13 billion in cash from Marlboro-maker Altria, Juul has money to spend to try to change minds that it's not the second coming of Big Tobacco. \"It's clear that we're focused on the mission of the company to convert people off combustible cigarettes,\" said Ann Hoey, Juul's vice president of marketing. \"This is campaign that is a sort of an honest, straight down the middle of the fairway, very clear communication about what we're trying to do as a company.\" Juul says its target audience is adults who want to stop smoking cigarettes, but its product has become wildly popular among teens and young adults. Critics have pointed to Juul's first ad campaign, which featured bright colors and youthful looking models, as evidence the company was intentionally marketing to young people. Juul has said it regrets the ads but denies it intentionally targeted teenagers. The company started overhauling its social media accounts last year to highlight testimonials from adults who had switched. It shut down its accounts in the fall facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration to fix the \"epidemic\" of youth e-cigarette use or else have products pulled from the market. Juul has already captured about 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data. However, it's unclear what percent of Juul's sales comes from former adult smokers and what percent comes teens, though critics would say too much comes from the latter group. In running advertisements highlighting stories of adults who have used Juul to stop smoking, it suggests the company sees an opportunity to reach more adult smokers. Over the past year, Juul captured 68 percent of the total $3.25 billion e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data ended Dec. 29 compiled by Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog. However, it represented just 3 percent of the $72.81 billion in overall tobacco sales, which includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars, according to Nielsen. Altria, maker of best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro, announced Dec. 20 that it bought a 35 percent stake in Juul for nearly $13 billion in cash. As part of the deal, Altria will give Juul some of its prime shelf space and add information about Juul to cigarette packs.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/juul-highlights-smokers-switching-to-e-cigarettes-in-ad-campaign.html", "tick": "MO"}

{"author": "CNBC", "headline": "Trump's attorney general nominee to recuse from AT&T-Time Warner appeal", "text": "William Barr, nominated by President Donald Trump to become U.S. attorney general, plans to recuse himself from a major antitrust case, according to people who spoke with him on Thursday, as he navigates possible conflicts of interest presented by about $37 million in assets he amassed as a private-sector lawyer. Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&amp;T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&amp;T last year, from 2009 until 2018. The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision. Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said. \"He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,\" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr. She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend. A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter. Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys. According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate. As of December 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well. Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria and drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan. Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/11/trumps-attorney-general-nominee-to-recuse-from-att-time-warner-appeal.html", "tick": "MO"}
{"author": "Angelica LaVito", "headline": "FDA explores how to help kids hooked on Juul, other e-cigarettes, quit", "text": "The Food and Drug Administration is exploring ways to help wean teenagers off nicotine as huge numbers of middle and high school students use Juul and other e-cigarettes. The uptick in vape usage has undercut and even eclipsed progress in reducing cigarette smoking, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says. Federal data showed teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed last year, prompting the surgeon general to declare it an \"epidemic\" and Gottlieb demanding manufacturers to fix it. Juul, the market leader, suspended sales of its fruity flavors in stores ahead of the FDA effectively pulling these products from convenience stores and limiting them to age-restricted stores like vape shops. Despite these efforts, anecdotal reports suggest some teenagers find themselves hooked on nicotine and unable to stop using e-cigarettes. Doctors treating kids don't have much information on how to properly treat them since the cessation products available today, like nicotine patches and gums, are meant only for adults. The agency put out the call for insight months ago and is holding a rescheduled public hearing on Friday at its Silver Spring, Maryland headquarters. \"For these addicted young people, the reasons that they tried e-cigarettes may not matter anymore,\" Gottlieb said in prepared remarks. \"These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit.\" E-cigarettes are billed as a way to help smokers get their nicotine fix without all the toxins that come with smoking cigarettes. However, the surge in young people using e-cigarettes has enraged parents, teachers and now even regulators. Gottlieb believes in e-cigarettes as a way to help adult smokers. But on Friday, he said the industry will face an \"existential threat\" if the number of teens using e-cigarettes does not decrease in this year's survey data. If the trends don't improve, he said, the conversation will shift from where fruity flavors can be sold to whether e-cigarettes can stay on the market. Gottlieb again dangled the threat of reversing a decision that allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications. \"It will be 'game over' for these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products.\" Gottlieb met with executives from five major manufacturers in the fall and plans to send follow-up meeting requests to the leaders of Altria and Juul. In December, Marlboro-maker Altria invested nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul. Two months earlier, Altria said it would voluntarily pull its flavors and pod-based products, saying these features, which Juul popularized, drove the surge in young people using e-cigarettes. \"I have real questions about whether there's consistency,\" Gottlieb told CNBC in an interview last week. Juul in a statement said it's moving \"full steam ahead\" on implementing the action plan it announced in November to prevent minors from using its products.  \"We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations in the effort to combat underage use,\" a spokesman said in a statement.  In the meantime, the FDA wants to find ways to stop teens from using e-cigarettes. Treatments for nicotine addiction on the market today are intended for adults, not minors. Pfizer's Chantix, a prescription drug to help adult smokers quit, failed a clinical trial last year studying whether it worked for teen smokers. Researchers, public health groups and vaping associations are slated to make presentations at Friday's hearing, though one group is noticeably absent from the agenda: drugmakers. Everyone who requested to give a formal presentation or share comments during the open session made it onto the agenda, the FDA said, meaning drug companies did not ask to participate.

Source: YChartsBased on the recent plunge in the stock price, does this represent a great entry point or a value squeeze? Let\u2019s take a look in greater detail.Reasons For The Recent SlideAs we alluded to above, MO has been under scrutiny the last few years for a multitude of reasons, from declining cigarette volume sales, to rising interest rates, to their recent acquisition of e-vape leader JUUL Labs, Inc. and investment in marijuana producer Cronos Group (OTC:CRON).The lure of Altria\u2019s business model is centered around their strong dividend track record and nature of their business being incredibly recession-resistant. The addictive nature of their products, which tend to provide stable revenues, is what makes them one of the defensive favorites among investors.The CDC recently reported that cigarette smoking has fallen to its lowest point in history. According to the CDC,An estimated 14 percent of adults in the U.S., or 34.3 million people, smoked cigarettes in 2017, down from 15.5 percent in 2016, according to the CDC. This historic low represents a 67 percent decline from 1965, when the National Health Interview Survey started tracking the figure and42.4 percent of adults smoked cigarettes.\u201d You may be thinking to yourself right now, \u2018OK if the smoking rates are falling, why are these guys suggesting I buy this stock?\u2019 Great question! As you can see, this has been a recurring trend since 1965, and it has yet to stop the likes of Altria or Philip Morris (PM) for that matter. The company has continued to fight lower volumes with higher prices, and because of the addictive nature of their products, it has continued to bring in solid cash flows.The company has long known about their declining volume, which is why they decided to get involved in the e-cigarette craze. E-cigarettes, or \u201cvaping\u201d for that matter, have come under intense scrutiny themselves of late, including stricter age requirements, and flavors, the agency believes, make them more attractive to younger users. The younger users is where most of the craze has gained traction, as according to the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey, it showed that vaping among high-school users increased 78%.The growth in e-cigarettes and the vaping craze then led the company to by vaping leader Juul Labs, Inc. (JUUL). MO acquired a 35% stake in Juul in late December for $12.8 billion, which valued the company at $38 billion. The valuation was more than twice the amount Juul was valued at through a private valuation during the summer of 2018. Investors were shocked at how much more the company paid for their stake, so much so that Citi analysts downgraded the stock to a \u201csell\u201d shortly after the acquisition. According to Wells Fargo analysis, Juul sales reached $1 billion last year. MO looked at the company as the dominant player in the industry, as they represent more than 75% of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen, but the regulations that potentially are to come are also what investors are focused on. So, not only are they worried about the valuation, but they are worried about future restrictions that are to come. One BIG reason government officials want to restrict these products is the fact that a single Juul pod contains as much nicotine as an ENTIRE PACK of regular cigarettes.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. Cannabis represents a \"opportunity\" for big tobacco as more and more U.S. states join those that have already OK'd the adult recreational use of cannabis. Cowen looks to North Dakota, Louisiana and West Virginia to come online and highlights Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania as additional key states to watch. \"After passage of the Farm Bill, CBD will clearly be one of the most topical areas within cannabis over the coming year,\" Azer wrote. \"We expect the category could generate $1.6 billion in revenues over the next year or two, depending on the timing of FDA commentary and the pace of retail acceptance.\" The $867 billion farm bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, includes a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had introduced. The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government's list of controlled substances, making it a lawful agricultural commodity. In response to the passage of the farm bill, Canopy CEO Bruce Linton told CNBC that it represents a key \"first step\" toward the company's expansion into the U.S. market. The Food and Drug Administration later said that it is looking for \"pathways\" to legalize the sale of CBD oil and other cannabis-based compounds in food and beverages in a move that could remove one of the last remaining legal hurdles for companies hoping to sell such products across state lines.

Even more surprisingly, the stock has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months. This is a very unusual move for this low-beta, slow-moving stock, which is well-known for its defensive characteristics even during bear markets. Due to this poor stock price performance, the tobacco giant is now trading at a 4-year low and is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade. The big question is whether the stock has become a great bargain.The headwinds1. Rising interest ratesMost investors have focused on the challenges facing the business of Altria in order to understand the reasons behind the downtrend of its stock. Nevertheless, they should realize that the environment of rising interest rates, which has nothing to do with the tobacco industry, is a strong headwind for the stock. As most of the shareholders of Altria are holding the stock for its generous and growing dividend, the stock is adversely affected by rising rates, which enable investors to find decent yields elsewhere and thus exert pressure on the valuation of the stock. It is thus only natural that the stock peaked in the summer of 2017, when interest rates were still near record-low levels.On the other hand, the Fed has raised interest rates too aggressively. Notably, its latest hike caused panic in the investing community over a potential recession within the next two years and thus triggered a market sell-off. Since then, Fed officials have been trying to alleviate the market with dovish comments. The Fed is thus likely to slow its pace of interest rate hikes from now on. Moreover, if a recession shows up, interest rates will decrease. Overall, this headwind is not likely to exert additional pressure on the stock for the foreseeable future.2. Acquisition of a stake in JUULWhile rising interest rates have weighed on Altria, another important factor behind its recent plunge is its acquisition of a stake in JUUL (JUUL), the e-vapor leader. Last month, Altria acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 B, thus valuing the company at $38 B. This amount is almost 2.5 times the $16 B valuation JUUL achieved in an investment round six months earlier and is also approximately 38 times the annual revenues of the e-vapor leader.It thus became evident that Altria was willing to purchase a significant stake in its competitor without paying any attention to the valuation. Consequently, the market perceived the deal as a desperate move of Altria to contain its losses from the transition of smokers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. The market also viewed the deal price as an admission of defeat of Altria. After the announcement of the deal, Citi downgraded Altria from \"neutral\" to \"sell\" and cut its price target from $67 to $45 due to the shareholder value destruction that resulted from the sky-high price of the deal.However, it is important to note that Altria essentially hedged its portfolio against the transition of consumers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. In other words, the tobacco giant essentially bought insurance for its business. Thanks to this insurance, it has drastically reduced its exposure to the headwinds facing its traditional products. In addition, as JUUL seems to have ample room to grow for many more years, the 35% stake in the company may begin to generate a significant income stream for Altria at some point in the future.Some investors are also concerned over the high amount of debt that will result from this deal. However, Altria has always spent minimal amounts on capital expenses. To be sure, its capital expenses have been less than 5% of its operating cash flows every single year in the last decade. As a result, the company enjoys excessive free cash flows, which can be used for shareholder distributions and debt reduction.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

The San Francisco-based e-cigarette company plans to launch over the summer its new TV campaign, featuring testimonials from adults who have used Juul to stop smoking cigarettes, executives said. The ads are likely to draw some controversy. Tobacco companies have long been restricted from most TV or print advertising, with marketing regulations stretching back to the 1970s. Federal and state regulators haven't yet applied the same standards to e-cigarettes, which are a relatively new product. Juul will initially spend almost $10 million for TV slots airing on national cable channels after 10 p.m. local time. The ads, a series of three different commercials, are aimed at adults 35 years and older, executives said. The 60-second spots feature three former smokers between the ages of 37 and 54 who talk about their experience with cigarettes, including how smoking strained relationships or isolated them from families and friends, and how Juul helped them quit smoking. The campaign marks the start of a year Juul will need to spend proving to regulators its product is ending up where its supposed to \u2014 in the hands of adult smokers, not teenagers. And fresh with nearly $13 billion in cash from Marlboro-maker Altria, Juul has money to spend to try to change minds that it's not the second coming of Big Tobacco. \"It's clear that we're focused on the mission of the company to convert people off combustible cigarettes,\" said Ann Hoey, Juul's vice president of marketing. \"This is campaign that is a sort of an honest, straight down the middle of the fairway, very clear communication about what we're trying to do as a company.\" Juul says its target audience is adults who want to stop smoking cigarettes, but its product has become wildly popular among teens and young adults. Critics have pointed to Juul's first ad campaign, which featured bright colors and youthful looking models, as evidence the company was intentionally marketing to young people. Juul has said it regrets the ads but denies it intentionally targeted teenagers. The company started overhauling its social media accounts last year to highlight testimonials from adults who had switched. It shut down its accounts in the fall facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration to fix the \"epidemic\" of youth e-cigarette use or else have products pulled from the market. Juul has already captured about 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data. However, it's unclear what percent of Juul's sales comes from former adult smokers and what percent comes teens, though critics would say too much comes from the latter group. In running advertisements highlighting stories of adults who have used Juul to stop smoking, it suggests the company sees an opportunity to reach more adult smokers. Over the past year, Juul captured 68 percent of the total $3.25 billion e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data ended Dec. 29 compiled by Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog. However, it represented just 3 percent of the $72.81 billion in overall tobacco sales, which includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars, according to Nielsen. Altria, maker of best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro, announced Dec. 20 that it bought a 35 percent stake in Juul for nearly $13 billion in cash. As part of the deal, Altria will give Juul some of its prime shelf space and add information about Juul to cigarette packs.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

SourceI have been openly taking the opposing view on Seeking Alpha as many investors believe Altria (MO) can do no wrong. In December, I wrote an article stating that Altria was cheap and offered a nice yield. (See: Altria Is Cheap With A Juicy Yield). Shortly thereafter, I sold my shares luckily before they dropped. I believed the deals they made were quite expensive and offered little immediate ROI. While the deal would have been good for the company at a lower price or better terms, this just doesn't seem attractive for shareholders at this price. In fact, I was looking forward to the deals Altria was going to make in both the marijuana space and the e-cigarette space. That being said, I believe even with a negative, forward-looking story, there becomes a point where the shares price in the risk and are worth what I would call a speculative buy. We shall review the deals again below and why the valuation seems enticing here.Acquisitions At A Cost Source: Seeking AlphaPaying $12.8 billion for a non-controlling stake in a company is certainly concerning. It is more concerning that this seems rather high considering this pegs the company with a value of $38 billion when it was valued at $16 billion only in the middle of this year. What I can judge from this is that the existing owners of JUUL (JUUL) did not value Altria and/or find it necessary to bring it in as a partner. They apparently were only interested in doing so at quite a premium to the last funding valuation. This is intriguing considering the extensive knowledge, distribution, and marketing power Altria has to offer. However, it is apparent that Altria wanted access to JUUL and was willing to pay anything for it. Altria now has faced a credit rating downgrade that leaves it with a BBB rating from S&amp;P. Moody's also cut its rating with a negative outlook alongside. This is due to the $15 billion being spent on deals in the last two months.Now, I do believe Altria is doing its best to be with the times and increase its reduced-risk portfolio as it has seen significant volume declines in its core business. However, it needs to do so in a manner that does not come across as desperate. How desperate is the management team that it was willing to pay 19x sales for a stake in a vaping company? Yes, the company is growing rather rapidly, but as the law of large numbers works, the sales growth will slow down. I am sure management has identified what it considers a market opportunity, but it is impossible to estimate what percentage of smokers will transition from combustible products to a vaporizing product. It is also notable that this transition will only cause share loss from Marlboro products. As Marlboro has a market-leading share, it stands to lose the most in the smokable category. According to Forbes, Marlboro had a 43.3% market share in 2017. Furthermore, the company may be promoting what could be an easier way for cigarette users to find an outlet to quit. A transition to a vaping product may allow for an easier out or quitting process of nicotine down the road as it has been proven to do. As noted in this article, which focuses on a study shows, vaping may lead to an easier route to quitting.While I appreciate the management team at Altria looking to participate in the future, I worry at what price, as stated above. Looking into the details of the deal, the company...\"...will be subject to a standstill agreement under which it may not acquire additional JUUL shares above its 35% interest. Altria agrees not to sell or transfer any JUUL common shares for six years from closing.\" - SourceThis agreement is of particular concern and seemed to be missed by many. Essentially, the company cannot gain the right to maintain a majority share for six years. While this may sound okay, it could come at an even costlier expense to shareholders, as the company would be worth more should sales continue to grow from today's pace. Even a simple double in valuation in the next six years, which seems practical considering the double in the last six months that Altria was willing to pay, would lead to a $76 billion valuation. And while this would obviously make Altria's existing stake very valuable, we must be clear in understanding that to acquire a controlling interest or even 16% of the company, it could cost Altria another $12+ billion. And, presumably, there would not be many in the market for a stake in JUUL at a valuation larger than even the one paid by Altria today.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&amp;T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&amp;T last year, from 2009 until 2018. The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision. Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said. \"He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,\" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr. She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend. A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter. Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys. According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate. As of December 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well. Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria and drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan. Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

The uptick in vape usage has undercut and even eclipsed progress in reducing cigarette smoking, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says. Federal data showed teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed last year, prompting the surgeon general to declare it an \"epidemic\" and Gottlieb demanding manufacturers to fix it. Juul, the market leader, suspended sales of its fruity flavors in stores ahead of the FDA effectively pulling these products from convenience stores and limiting them to age-restricted stores like vape shops. Despite these efforts, anecdotal reports suggest some teenagers find themselves hooked on nicotine and unable to stop using e-cigarettes. Doctors treating kids don't have much information on how to properly treat them since the cessation products available today, like nicotine patches and gums, are meant only for adults. The agency put out the call for insight months ago and is holding a rescheduled public hearing on Friday at its Silver Spring, Maryland headquarters. \"For these addicted young people, the reasons that they tried e-cigarettes may not matter anymore,\" Gottlieb said in prepared remarks. \"These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit.\" E-cigarettes are billed as a way to help smokers get their nicotine fix without all the toxins that come with smoking cigarettes. However, the surge in young people using e-cigarettes has enraged parents, teachers and now even regulators. Gottlieb believes in e-cigarettes as a way to help adult smokers. But on Friday, he said the industry will face an \"existential threat\" if the number of teens using e-cigarettes does not decrease in this year's survey data. If the trends don't improve, he said, the conversation will shift from where fruity flavors can be sold to whether e-cigarettes can stay on the market. Gottlieb again dangled the threat of reversing a decision that allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications. \"It will be 'game over' for these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process,\" Gottlieb said. \"I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products.\" Gottlieb met with executives from five major manufacturers in the fall and plans to send follow-up meeting requests to the leaders of Altria and Juul. In December, Marlboro-maker Altria invested nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul. Two months earlier, Altria said it would voluntarily pull its flavors and pod-based products, saying these features, which Juul popularized, drove the surge in young people using e-cigarettes. \"I have real questions about whether there's consistency,\" Gottlieb told CNBC in an interview last week. Juul in a statement said it's moving \"full steam ahead\" on implementing the action plan it announced in November to prevent minors from using its products.  \"We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations in the effort to combat underage use,\" a spokesman said in a statement.  In the meantime, the FDA wants to find ways to stop teens from using e-cigarettes. Treatments for nicotine addiction on the market today are intended for adults, not minors. Pfizer's Chantix, a prescription drug to help adult smokers quit, failed a clinical trial last year studying whether it worked for teen smokers. Researchers, public health groups and vaping associations are slated to make presentations at Friday's hearing, though one group is noticeably absent from the agenda: drugmakers. Everyone who requested to give a formal presentation or share comments during the open session made it onto the agenda, the FDA said, meaning drug companies did not ask to participate.

It seems that Morgan Stanleyhas three major complaints in reference to Altria, and they are:1) The negative impact of accelerating cigarette volume declines (estimated at -6%).2) MS notes that a higher mix of low-income smokers in the years ahead could impact Altria's pricing flexibility, per Bloomberg.3) The $12.8B investment in Juul also is seen ata high valuation.Morgan Stanley is clearly not very excited about Altria\u2019s future prospects and it's quite interesting that its analysts think Altria\u2019s shares could go a lot lower in price from these already dramatically lower levels. Upon reading the Seeking Alpha news link on MO, a subscriber to our Seeking Alpha Marketplace service asked me if I could write an article about Altria, answering the following question:\u201cWhat should I do with my MO shares, now that it's paying a 7.12% dividend?\u201d In this article I will not discuss the various operations of Altria and how each is doing, as you can read many such articles on Seeking Alpha, both pro and con. What I will simply do is a quantitative analysis of Altria\u2019s results on Main Street and then relate them to what an investor should do on Wall Street, using zero emotion.Let us now go and analyze Altria and find out what our Friedrich algorithm has to say about all this.Main Street vs. Wall StreetIn analyzing Altria, we will present some unique ratios that our Friedrich Investing System uses and will present a real-time quantitative analysis that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process. In doing so, we also will teach everyone how to analyze one's portfolio holdings on Main Street vs. Wall Street. At the same time, we will explain how the methodology involved in this analysis came about.Main Street is where Altria operates, and Wall Street is where its shares trade. The Altria shares that one can purchase on Wall Street are traded publicly on exchanges and the company has little control over how each share will trade. Altria is required to release its earnings reports each quarter and, from time to time, it also provides press releases to its shareholders (and the general public) giving updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where Altria invests in its own operations and sells to its customers. How well the CEO of Altria and its management do in selling those products determines how profitable the company will be. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet its goals. Main Street and Wall Street are thus interlinked, but because anyone with a computer (or even just a smartphone), an internet connection, and a brokerage account can buy or sell any stock at any time, expertise is not a requirement in order to invest on Wall Street.This results in Wall Street being a very dangerous place to operate as many investors tend to invest through emotion or follow the herd in and out of stocks. During bull markets, investors feel like they can do no wrong as \"the rising tide lifts all boats.\" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic, and like lemmings stampede over the cliff. Thus, we have the classic case of \"greed vs. panic.\"", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

(NASDAQ:CRON) | Seeking Alpha", "author": "Cornerstone Investments", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235488-cronos-overtook-tilray-expensive-cannabis-stock?source=cnbc", "text": "SummaryBoth Cronos and Tilray are likely overvalued stock due to different reasons but the two stocks had been trading very differently.Tilray initially benefited from a perfect combination of events including a well-timed Nasdaq IPO and a small float.Cronos secured a blockbuster investment from Altria which provided valuation support and instant validation.We think Tilray's slow deflation is as expected but Cronos remains a show-me story despite being the chosen one at Altria.Tilray (TLRY) has been portrayed by most investors as the most expensive cannabis stock on earth. Trading at 155x annualized last quarter revenue, many thought the bubble can't get any worse than Tilray. However, Cronos (CRON) has quietly overtaken Tilray as the most expensive stock as both stocks traded in opposite directions during the last few months.Tilray Slowly Deflating We all know Tilray is overvalued. There have been hundreds of articles written on this stock all over the internet. In any case, it does not seem to make sense that few months after it completed its IPO at US$17 per share, the stock could reach as high as US$300 at one point. We have told readers that a fair price would have been US$30 - $40 when the cannabis market was red hot. However, without too much attention, Tilray's stock has actually been slowly deflating. The stock closed around US$70 last week, trading \"just 4x\" above the IPO price and down ~80% from its all-time high. (Source: Bloomberg)In the meantime, Tilray has announced a US$100 million joint research project with AB InBev (BUD) that had little impact on the stock. The weak Q3 reported by the company did not help either, as investors reassess the then-most expensive stock on earth to see how much it's actually worth. The largest private shareholder of Tilray, Privateer, recently announced that it doesn't intend to sell any of the 75 million shares it owns in 1H 2019. The shares soared on the news but have since come down.Then there comes Cronos.Cronos Bucking The TrendCronos was included as one of our worst calls in 2018 as we have been cautious on this stock since its Nasdaq listing. The stock has done very little in terms of execution in the domestic Canadian market. However, the Altria (MO) investment has altered the story as one could do many things with US$1.8 billion of cash. The stock has traded up significantly since the Altria announcement on December 7. In fact, Cronos shares climbed 40% that week and significantly outperformed just about every single other cannabis stock in the world. Cronos is now trading at its all-time high and well above the price Altria that paid at C$16.25. Altria has warrants exercisable at C$19.00 which are actually in the money right now. (Source: Bloomberg)Cronos More Expensive Than TilrayThe result of the divergent share price performances in the last few months is that Cronos has overtaken Tilray as the most expensive cannabis stock now. Based on the last quarter revenue reported by both companies and the market capitalization as of last Friday (Cronos has been adjusted to reflect Altria's investment), Cronos trades at 266x versus Tilray at 155x EV / revenue.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}
{"tick": "MO", "headline": "Big Write-Off Coming From Altria As Juul Dreams Go Up In Smoke - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha", "author": "Trapping Value", "link": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235302-big-write-coming-altria-juul-dreams-go-smoke", "text": "SummaryAltria's $12.8 billion investment in Juul came at a very high multiple.The timing was fantastic for Juul but horrible for Altria.The stock is reflecting a big write-off.We explain why that is most likely and what the impact will be.When we last spoke about Altria (MO), we concludedMO's acquisition was extremely ill-timed. It likely did face pressures of acting, in case some other tobacco company moved first. But by doing so, it created the typical first mover disadvantage at likely the worst possible time. The value destruction is obvious to us. That said, MO is now at a reasonable valuation where the risks of declining sales and even the silly acquisition are priced in. We were negative on the stock earlier and now think that it is much closer to fair value.Source: Altria: I Pity The Fool Who Paid $36 Billion For JUULSince then, the stock has continued to tumble with Morgan Stanley's (MS) latest note striking more panic in the heart of bulls. The recent FDA speech made even the most ardent bulls take notice that the FDA is now very close to intervening in the market. The key takeaways from that speech were, FDA is concerned by an alarming rise in use of e-cigarettes, particularly JUUL among teenagers. From 2017 to 2018, there was a 78% increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48% increase among middle school students. The total number of middle and high school students currently using e-cigarettes rose to 3.6 million \u2014 that\u2019s 1.5 million more students using these products than the previous year. FDA has already taken steps to address this and basically will not stop until this trend is reversed. If that means a complete ban of e-cigarettes, they are ready to go there. While investors may downplay that a complete ban will not happen, absolutely any kind of containment of JUUL growth means Altria will be taking an epic write-down.When you pay nosebleed valuations, things better work out wellWe had recently made the comment on NVDIA (NVDA) that things never work out for investors when they purchase a large cap stock at 15X sales. NVDA is at about half that price currently.Altria's purchase price valued JUUL at 36X sales. The total enterprise value of JUUL would make it a large cap, making disappointment guaranteed for Altria. But in Altria's case the write-down will come when the auditors give their opinion at the next annual report. The reasons are quite obvious here. Altria has acquired the JUUL stake just when JUUL was growing at close to 800%. At that point, JUUL\u2019s dollar sales had skyrocketed 783 percent in the 52 weeks ended June 16, reaching $942.6 million, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. The e-cigarette category as a whole grew 97 percent to $1.96 billion in the same period. JUUL now represents more than 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the Nielsen numbers. Essentially, JUUL sales grew from $106.79 million to $942.6 million.In other words, JUUL accounted for 85% of the total growth in e-cigarettes. It is obvious why the FDA is specifically targeting JUUL. JUUL is not part of the problem, it is the problem. But more from the point of Altria's investment, we can extrapolate a few numbers to see how this will play out. To do that we will have to make some assumptions about JUUL's profitability. Considering JUUL itself is private, we will use Altria's numbers to help out.Altria itself reports rather strong gross margins and operating margins. Source: Altria 2017 annual report2017 was the best year for Altria with a rather hefty 37% operating margin. Assuming JUUL can reach the same economies of scale and is not threatened by competition, we can assume similar operating margins for it. Taking a step forward, a 30% net after tax margin is not big stretch either. These assumptions are optimistic as even if e-cigarettes are not banned JUUL will have more competition than the existing companies in the dying tobacco industry face today.All industries mature at some point and some even go into terminal decline. If we assume that at the steady state point JUUL would be worth about 15X earnings, we can extrapolate the kind of sales it needs to get there.
