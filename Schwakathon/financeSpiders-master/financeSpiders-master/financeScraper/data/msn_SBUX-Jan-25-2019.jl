A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings \"that for the most part are beating expectations\" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members. For customers not interested in the loyalty program, Starbucks has been building an email list \u2014 now 13 million strong \u2014 to promote its products and deals.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something \"for free,\" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free \u2014 all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales \u2013 or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good \u2013 I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if \u2013 why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that. And right now that's not on the road map. But you know, we are mindful of the trends, we're mindful of how -- I'll say CBD oils and CBD is viewed as a health and wellness. And so, you know, we're going to keep watching this. But right now, not on the road map. CARL QUINTANILLA: You need to go work for Starbucks R&amp;D, Jim. JIM CRAMER: Believe me, I'm ready to don a green apron in a flash. Because you can get benefits like no other company. Congratulations. And by the way, these guys hire veterans like there is no tomorrow and they deserve it if everybody else did this, then every veteran would have a job. That's what they do. What do you say, David? DAVID FABER: We still have Kevin with us or are we wrapping him up? JIM CRAMER: No, he's right there. DAVID FABER: I'm not hearing what -- whether we got time. Kevin, I'm curious about this line of questioning that Jim opened up about AI and what you're learning or how you're doing it. Can you give us more sense as to how that works or what that meant on the ground during the Christmas season for, for example, in terms of your ability to fulfill customers and a more effective way? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, I'll frame it sort of, David, around customer insights. And coming out of last year's holiday, we used a number of tools and research to give us customer insights on what customers really appreciated and loved about Starbucks at the holiday. And that informed everything from the design of our cups to the, you know, utilizing the re-useable red cup promotion that we launched. You know, we saw gift card sales grow 4% year on year on the quarter. That was a function of customer insight and research that we did. So this holiday, in many ways, was informed by that insight. And that's an example of what we are doing. We're using all kinds of data, customer focus groups and things to help us be more informed, more front footed on the trends and the things that customers really want to see from Starbucks. JIM CRAMER: Okay. Well, Kevin what the customers may want to see in China is a cup that is not an American cup, because people are worried about tension in the same way that Xiaomi has been able to take share from Apple \u2013 what are you drinking? You've got a Starbucks? You don't even have a cup \u2013 a label on there. Can you hold that cup up? Does it say Starbucks on it? Alright, so -- KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, this is a \u2013 Jim, we're in the Roastery. We have a Starbucks Reserve right here. JIM CRAMER: Kevin, this Luckin, they've put up 600 stores in seven months, they're coming in 20 to 30% under you. Why wouldn't I want to go to Luckin over Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, first of all, you know, when you look at a competitor like Luckin, they talk about the number of units that they're growing. And I think sometimes a unit would look perhaps like a Starbucks store, but most of the times they look like a point of presence. And so, you know, you need to visit these for yourself. That said, you know, having a lot of points of presence, we're at 370 stores, we have our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle coming in, with food services and CPG. The reason you want to come to Starbucks is because we create that unique customer experience, we serve the world's finest Arabica coffee. Our partners will hand craft beverage to your perfection, and we create an experience like no other in the industry. And we're going to continue to stay true to the experience we create in our stores and how we extend that experience with the digital mobile relationship. The China digital partnership with Alibaba is making great progress. We now have the virtual Starbucks store integrated into the Alibaba properties. That's now reaching 600 million Chinese who use Alibaba on a daily basis. And so, you know, we think the strategy that we're on is the right one, it is allowing us now to continue to grow transactions in the double digits. And we're going to continue to play the long game with the strategy that made Starbucks what it is today in China. JIM CRAMER: Well, thank you so much, Kevin, for coming on, for playing. Because we have tough questions and good questions. This is the best quarter for a couple of years. Great job. That's Kevin Johnson, he's the President and CEO of Starbucks.

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings \"that for the most part are beating expectations\" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members. For customers not interested in the loyalty program, Starbucks has been building an email list \u2014 now 13 million strong \u2014 to promote its products and deals.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something \"for free,\" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free \u2014 all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales \u2013 or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good \u2013 I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if \u2013 why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that. And right now that's not on the road map. But you know, we are mindful of the trends, we're mindful of how -- I'll say CBD oils and CBD is viewed as a health and wellness. And so, you know, we're going to keep watching this. But right now, not on the road map. CARL QUINTANILLA: You need to go work for Starbucks R&amp;D, Jim. JIM CRAMER: Believe me, I'm ready to don a green apron in a flash. Because you can get benefits like no other company. Congratulations. And by the way, these guys hire veterans like there is no tomorrow and they deserve it if everybody else did this, then every veteran would have a job. That's what they do. What do you say, David? DAVID FABER: We still have Kevin with us or are we wrapping him up? JIM CRAMER: No, he's right there. DAVID FABER: I'm not hearing what -- whether we got time. Kevin, I'm curious about this line of questioning that Jim opened up about AI and what you're learning or how you're doing it. Can you give us more sense as to how that works or what that meant on the ground during the Christmas season for, for example, in terms of your ability to fulfill customers and a more effective way? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, I'll frame it sort of, David, around customer insights. And coming out of last year's holiday, we used a number of tools and research to give us customer insights on what customers really appreciated and loved about Starbucks at the holiday. And that informed everything from the design of our cups to the, you know, utilizing the re-useable red cup promotion that we launched. You know, we saw gift card sales grow 4% year on year on the quarter. That was a function of customer insight and research that we did. So this holiday, in many ways, was informed by that insight. And that's an example of what we are doing. We're using all kinds of data, customer focus groups and things to help us be more informed, more front footed on the trends and the things that customers really want to see from Starbucks. JIM CRAMER: Okay. Well, Kevin what the customers may want to see in China is a cup that is not an American cup, because people are worried about tension in the same way that Xiaomi has been able to take share from Apple \u2013 what are you drinking? You've got a Starbucks? You don't even have a cup \u2013 a label on there. Can you hold that cup up? Does it say Starbucks on it? Alright, so -- KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, this is a \u2013 Jim, we're in the Roastery. We have a Starbucks Reserve right here. JIM CRAMER: Kevin, this Luckin, they've put up 600 stores in seven months, they're coming in 20 to 30% under you. Why wouldn't I want to go to Luckin over Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, first of all, you know, when you look at a competitor like Luckin, they talk about the number of units that they're growing. And I think sometimes a unit would look perhaps like a Starbucks store, but most of the times they look like a point of presence. And so, you know, you need to visit these for yourself. That said, you know, having a lot of points of presence, we're at 370 stores, we have our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle coming in, with food services and CPG. The reason you want to come to Starbucks is because we create that unique customer experience, we serve the world's finest Arabica coffee. Our partners will hand craft beverage to your perfection, and we create an experience like no other in the industry. And we're going to continue to stay true to the experience we create in our stores and how we extend that experience with the digital mobile relationship. The China digital partnership with Alibaba is making great progress. We now have the virtual Starbucks store integrated into the Alibaba properties. That's now reaching 600 million Chinese who use Alibaba on a daily basis. And so, you know, we think the strategy that we're on is the right one, it is allowing us now to continue to grow transactions in the double digits. And we're going to continue to play the long game with the strategy that made Starbucks what it is today in China. JIM CRAMER: Well, thank you so much, Kevin, for coming on, for playing.

All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales \u2013 or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good \u2013 I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if \u2013 why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that. And right now that's not on the road map. But you know, we are mindful of the trends, we're mindful of how -- I'll say CBD oils and CBD is viewed as a health and wellness. And so, you know, we're going to keep watching this. But right now, not on the road map. CARL QUINTANILLA: You need to go work for Starbucks R&amp;D, Jim. JIM CRAMER: Believe me, I'm ready to don a green apron in a flash. Because you can get benefits like no other company. Congratulations. And by the way, these guys hire veterans like there is no tomorrow and they deserve it if everybody else did this, then every veteran would have a job. That's what they do. What do you say, David? DAVID FABER: We still have Kevin with us or are we wrapping him up? JIM CRAMER: No, he's right there. DAVID FABER: I'm not hearing what -- whether we got time. Kevin, I'm curious about this line of questioning that Jim opened up about AI and what you're learning or how you're doing it. Can you give us more sense as to how that works or what that meant on the ground during the Christmas season for, for example, in terms of your ability to fulfill customers and a more effective way? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, I'll frame it sort of, David, around customer insights. And coming out of last year's holiday, we used a number of tools and research to give us customer insights on what customers really appreciated and loved about Starbucks at the holiday. And that informed everything from the design of our cups to the, you know, utilizing the re-useable red cup promotion that we launched. You know, we saw gift card sales grow 4% year on year on the quarter. That was a function of customer insight and research that we did. So this holiday, in many ways, was informed by that insight. And that's an example of what we are doing. We're using all kinds of data, customer focus groups and things to help us be more informed, more front footed on the trends and the things that customers really want to see from Starbucks. JIM CRAMER: Okay. Well, Kevin what the customers may want to see in China is a cup that is not an American cup, because people are worried about tension in the same way that Xiaomi has been able to take share from Apple \u2013 what are you drinking? You've got a Starbucks? You don't even have a cup \u2013 a label on there. Can you hold that cup up? Does it say Starbucks on it? Alright, so -- KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, this is a \u2013 Jim, we're in the Roastery. We have a Starbucks Reserve right here. JIM CRAMER: Kevin, this Luckin, they've put up 600 stores in seven months, they're coming in 20 to 30% under you. Why wouldn't I want to go to Luckin over Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, first of all, you know, when you look at a competitor like Luckin, they talk about the number of units that they're growing. And I think sometimes a unit would look perhaps like a Starbucks store, but most of the times they look like a point of presence. And so, you know, you need to visit these for yourself. That said, you know, having a lot of points of presence, we're at 370 stores, we have our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle coming in, with food services and CPG. The reason you want to come to Starbucks is because we create that unique customer experience, we serve the world's finest Arabica coffee. Our partners will hand craft beverage to your perfection, and we create an experience like no other in the industry. And we're going to continue to stay true to the experience we create in our stores and how we extend that experience with the digital mobile relationship. The China digital partnership with Alibaba is making great progress. We now have the virtual Starbucks store integrated into the Alibaba properties. That's now reaching 600 million Chinese who use Alibaba on a daily basis. And so, you know, we think the strategy that we're on is the right one, it is allowing us now to continue to grow transactions in the double digits. And we're going to continue to play the long game with the strategy that made Starbucks what it is today in China. JIM CRAMER: Well, thank you so much, Kevin, for coming on, for playing. Because we have tough questions and good questions. This is the best quarter for a couple of years. Great job. That's Kevin Johnson, he's the President and CEO of Starbucks.

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings \"that for the most part are beating expectations\" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members.

I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something \"for free,\" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free \u2014 all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

Western Digital\u2013 The semiconductor stock jumped 7.5 percent. Western Digital's earnings were below expectations yet investors welcomed the company's efforts to cut costs.

Hackett said Ford aims to nearly double its annual operating profit, although he did not specify when that would happen.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq on track to eke out gains for the shortened holiday week. But the S&amp;P 500 looked set to show its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. President Donald Trump said he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. This helped boost investor sentiment, which faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. \"Obviously the risk is on today,\" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. \"There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with resolving the government shutdown.\" \"But I find it difficult to have much conviction in this market on an upswing when there's so much uncertainty both politically and economically about where this country is headed,\" Baumohl added. Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China remains an overhang. With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are \"fed up\" with President Donald Trump's policies. An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide.
