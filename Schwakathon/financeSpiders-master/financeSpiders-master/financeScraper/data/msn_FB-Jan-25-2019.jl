That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,\" Cramer told viewers. \"World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps.\" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. \"She can have that opinion,\" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on \"Mad Money.\" \"I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.\"  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication \"in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.\"  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday.

The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's \"earnings Super Bowl,\" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. \"It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,\" he said. \"Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype.\" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. \"In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,\" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is \"flirting with 3 percent,\" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. \"We can afford to wait this out. They can't,\" he said. \"So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: \"I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need.\" E-Trade Financial Corp.: \"I think it's good. I do lament \u2013 I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook.

Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks \u2014 Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth \u2014 but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. \"They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat \u2014 at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. \"This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,\" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. \"In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,\" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. \"I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,\" she said. \"In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.\" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. \"When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,\" Calvasina said. \"Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.\" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.\"The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,\" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. \"We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,\" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize.\" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, \"this stock could fly,\" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for \"shooting itself in the foot.\" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant \"one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,\" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. \"This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,\" he noted. \"I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock.\" Pfizer: The \"Mad Money\" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. \"It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,\" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   \"I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,\" Cramer warned. \"That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back.\" But, he admitted, \"I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday].\" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: \"The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around.\" AT&amp;T: The \"Mad Money\" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. \"If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,\" Cramer said. \"He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings \u2014 that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful.\" Tesla: \"A boatload of controversy\" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. \"My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,\" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less \"inured to negativity at this point,\" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,\" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has \"been on fire of late,\" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a \"crowded\" day. \"We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,\" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. \"The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,\" he said. \"Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more.\" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a \"quandary\" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was \"getting too much advance attention from the bulls.\" The Amazon zealots are \"starting to squawk about an upside surprise,\" he said. \"That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it.\" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The \"remarkable rebound\" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. \"I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,\" he said. The \"Mad Money\" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. \"I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,\" he acknowledged. \"You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P.

The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. \"There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. \"If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,\" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an \"extreme remedy\" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. \"I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,\" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. \"My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.\" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. \"It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,\" Stamos said.

Stone presumably favored WhatsApp because it's one of a very few services that offer \"end-to-end encryption\" on both messages and phone calls, as well as communications that include photographs and documents. This means messages sent via the platform are scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can view them on their respective devices, making it almost impossible for outsiders to monitor communications. Even the information about who's on the other end of the line is obscured from view, so outsiders can't easily scan carrier records or internet service provider records to discover that two parties were in touch. WhatsApp voice calls, which appear to be what Stone was allegedly proposing, are similarly encrypted. Somebody within earshot could hear the conversation, but the data making up the voices on the call are encrypted in transit, and prying parties trying to tap any line in between would likely be unable to monitor the scrambled content of the conversation. This may not work, however, if either party is running an old version of the application, so it's not foolproof. These features have made WhatsApp a favorite of many people who wish to keep their communications under an additional layer of privacy. They include criminals and terrorists \u2014 but also people who simply enjoy privacy, and even cybersecurity experts battling criminals. Security professionals often use applications like WhatsApp to communicate \"out of band\" \u2014 in other words, off official work channels \u2014 about investigations that they need to keep private internally. It's unclear from Stone's indictment whether any of the communications cited were actually conducted via WhatsApp or came from other channels. But even if WhatsApp had been used, the special counsel investigation so far has shown these communications are recoverable in some circumstances, as they apparently have for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. For instance, if somebody on either end of the conversation willingly gives up the information, or it's stored on a device that's not password-protected and belongs to one of the parties, then it's possible for an outsider to see what was discussed. Competitors in the encrypted communications space \u2014 including my favorites, Wickr and Signal \u2014 offer similar advantages with some added security benefits as well. For instance, Wickr lets you thoroughly destroy old messages and make encrypted video calls and voice memos, and Signal offers simple group messaging and lets you set a time limit on when to destroy messages. WhatsApp may face an uphill battle in continuing to appeal to those seeking heightened access to private communication channels, as Facebook links its other products to the application.

Engineering is the domain of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Sales is COO Sheryl Sandberg's. Engineers like to work comfortably and quietly. Sales is loud. Engineering is young and very male. Sales skews older and more diverse. Most engineers can go their entire Facebook careers without ever meeting a salesperson, while only the best sales employees take the time to build relationships with engineers (who can come in handy whenever a client runs into a technical problem). And in most of Facebook's offices, engineers and salespeople rarely interact. At the headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for example, the two work in completely separate buildings. But there are times when the two cultures clash. These clashes are rare, but highlight the tension Facebook faces every day: It must build products that users love and want to use, while simultaneously providing enough value to advertisers to keep the lights on.  One such clash came in 2015 at Facebook's New York offices, one of the most densely populated in the company. Although sales and engineering were kept on separate floors in New York, the two departments shared a common cafeteria. Facebook's New York sales employees often brought big clients into the office for visits, taking them to lunch while on their visits. In that same space, engineers flexed their predilection for comfort. \"Engineers were going to cafeteria without their shoes on, and a sales person wrote, 'Hey, we have clients. Please keep in mind this is a professional environment,'\" a former Facebook sales employee told CNBC. \"Everyone just treated it like a living room,\" said one former contractor. \"That's pretty much what they encouraged \u2026 you wouldn't bat an eye if someone was walking around in slippers or socks.\" \"It was bizarre,\" said another former contractor. The former sales employee recalled seeing engineers walk barefoot into the bathroom and then barefoot into the cafeteria. The salesperson's post caused \"a flare up\" on the company's internal social network and in the New York office, according to five former employees and contractors who remember the incident, now known as \"shoegate.\" Sales and engineering employees left hundreds of comments defending both sides of the shoeless debate, and debating which side of the company was more important. The crux of the debate came down to: engineers build the product, but the salespeople keep the lights on. Despite the battle of words, none of the former employees recall the company implementing any changes to the policy regarding shoes. In 2016, Facebook leased space at another location in New York, giving the two divisions more breathing room to coexist, but at that moment in time, it was \"a clash of cultures,\" a former employee said.

That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,\" Cramer told viewers. \"World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps.\" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. \"She can have that opinion,\" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on \"Mad Money.\" \"I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.\"  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication \"in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.\"  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's \"earnings Super Bowl,\" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. \"It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,\" he said. \"Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype.\" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. \"In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,\" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is \"flirting with 3 percent,\" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. \"We can afford to wait this out. They can't,\" he said. \"So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: \"I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need.\" E-Trade Financial Corp.: \"I think it's good. I do lament \u2013 I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Source: ForbesFacebook (FB) reports quarterly earnings on January 30th. Analysts expect revenue of $16.4 billion and EPS of $2.19. The revenue estimate implies 26% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.Stagnant MAU GrowthFacebook's top line continues to show tremendous growth. I assumed that once its revenue got to a certain level that its growth would plateau. That moment has yet to arrive. Implied 26% revenue growth this quarter follows 33% growth in Q3. Operating income only grew 13% Y/Y as operating income margin fell to 42% from 50% in the year-earlier period. Facebook has increased investments in infrastructure, safety, and security in reaction to regulatory pressures. I find it difficult to believe the company cannot cut into these costs if revenue growth slows.Monthly active users (\"MAUs\") are already slowing. More than 2.6 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger each month, up from 2.5 billion in Q2 2018. This is a big selling point to advertisers; they can reach over 2 billion people with one advertising campaign. The question is, \"How do you value that pool of users?\" MAUs were 2.3 billion at Q3 2018, up 10% Y/Y and 2% sequentially. As the chart illustrates, MAU growth appeared to have plateaued in Q4 2017. The days of double-digit sequential growth in MAUs are a thing of the past. MAUs could come under further scrutiny after PlainSite alleged a massive number of Facebook's accounts are fake: Facebook shares have fallen in the past hour, giving up the day's gains, coinciding with a negative report from PlainSite alleging a massive number of fake accounts. PlainSite says more than 50% of Facebook's accounts are \"very likely fake.\" Moreover, PlainSite says the company is lying about is fake accounts, which would make it liable to its advertising customers for billions of dollars. That said, double-digit sequential growth in MAUs is a thing of the past. Will that alone dampen sentiment for the FB? I doubt it.FB bulls will likely look for any reason to keep buying the stock. The fact that revenue growth is still robust could give bulls hope. Revenue growth that exceeds MAU growth implies average revenue per user (\"ARPU\") is increasing. I understand MAUs for Instagram and WhatsApp are growing faster than overall MAUs. Facebook may be increasing ARPU for these revenue streams due to higher levels of engagement.WhatsApp and Instagram may be cannibalizing Facebook sales. They are also likely causing growth in daily active users (\"DAUs\") at Snapchat (SNAP) to stagnate. Facebook has scale (over 2 billion MAUs) and it also owns two of social media's fastest growing platforms (Instagram and WhatsApp). It could give the company more pricing power. ARPU could change the narrative and get investors to focus less on declining growth in MAUs.The Economy Is Showing CracksAt the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company. It sells ads to clients who want to access its massive user base. Regulators, particularly in Europe, are starting to set restraints on the company as it would on any other media outlet. I believe Facebook's revenue and earnings could get hit hard during the next economic downturn, just likely cyclical advertising and media outlets.The Federal Reserve is undoing some of the stimulus it provided over the past decade. Revenue growth at certain industrial giants is now slowing. General Electric's (GE) core Power business is being disrupted by alternative energy sources and Ford (F) is losing money in major markets outside North America. We will learn more about the earnings of 3M (MMM) and Honeywell (HON) next week. They could give us more clarity on whether the global economy is headed lower. If the economy falters (which I believe it will), it will likely tamp down large advertising campaigns by industrial giants and/or consumer brands. This would not be good for Facebook.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

Stone presumably favored WhatsApp because it's one of a very few services that offer \"end-to-end encryption\" on both messages and phone calls, as well as communications that include photographs and documents. This means messages sent via the platform are scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can view them on their respective devices, making it almost impossible for outsiders to monitor communications. Even the information about who's on the other end of the line is obscured from view, so outsiders can't easily scan carrier records or internet service provider records to discover that two parties were in touch. WhatsApp voice calls, which appear to be what Stone was allegedly proposing, are similarly encrypted. Somebody within earshot could hear the conversation, but the data making up the voices on the call are encrypted in transit, and prying parties trying to tap any line in between would likely be unable to monitor the scrambled content of the conversation. This may not work, however, if either party is running an old version of the application, so it's not foolproof. These features have made WhatsApp a favorite of many people who wish to keep their communications under an additional layer of privacy. They include criminals and terrorists \u2014 but also people who simply enjoy privacy, and even cybersecurity experts battling criminals. Security professionals often use applications like WhatsApp to communicate \"out of band\" \u2014 in other words, off official work channels \u2014 about investigations that they need to keep private internally. It's unclear from Stone's indictment whether any of the communications cited were actually conducted via WhatsApp or came from other channels. But even if WhatsApp had been used, the special counsel investigation so far has shown these communications are recoverable in some circumstances, as they apparently have for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. For instance, if somebody on either end of the conversation willingly gives up the information, or it's stored on a device that's not password-protected and belongs to one of the parties, then it's possible for an outsider to see what was discussed. Competitors in the encrypted communications space \u2014 including my favorites, Wickr and Signal \u2014 offer similar advantages with some added security benefits as well. For instance, Wickr lets you thoroughly destroy old messages and make encrypted video calls and voice memos, and Signal offers simple group messaging and lets you set a time limit on when to destroy messages. WhatsApp may face an uphill battle in continuing to appeal to those seeking heightened access to private communication channels, as Facebook links its other products to the application.

Engineering is the domain of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Sales is COO Sheryl Sandberg's. Engineers like to work comfortably and quietly. Sales is loud. Engineering is young and very male. Sales skews older and more diverse. Most engineers can go their entire Facebook careers without ever meeting a salesperson, while only the best sales employees take the time to build relationships with engineers (who can come in handy whenever a client runs into a technical problem). And in most of Facebook's offices, engineers and salespeople rarely interact. At the headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for example, the two work in completely separate buildings. But there are times when the two cultures clash. These clashes are rare, but highlight the tension Facebook faces every day: It must build products that users love and want to use, while simultaneously providing enough value to advertisers to keep the lights on.  One such clash came in 2015 at Facebook's New York offices, one of the most densely populated in the company. Although sales and engineering were kept on separate floors in New York, the two departments shared a common cafeteria. Facebook's New York sales employees often brought big clients into the office for visits, taking them to lunch while on their visits. In that same space, engineers flexed their predilection for comfort. \"Engineers were going to cafeteria without their shoes on, and a sales person wrote, 'Hey, we have clients. Please keep in mind this is a professional environment,'\" a former Facebook sales employee told CNBC. \"Everyone just treated it like a living room,\" said one former contractor. \"That's pretty much what they encouraged \u2026 you wouldn't bat an eye if someone was walking around in slippers or socks.\" \"It was bizarre,\" said another former contractor. The former sales employee recalled seeing engineers walk barefoot into the bathroom and then barefoot into the cafeteria. The salesperson's post caused \"a flare up\" on the company's internal social network and in the New York office, according to five former employees and contractors who remember the incident, now known as \"shoegate.\" Sales and engineering employees left hundreds of comments defending both sides of the shoeless debate, and debating which side of the company was more important. The crux of the debate came down to: engineers build the product, but the salespeople keep the lights on. Despite the battle of words, none of the former employees recall the company implementing any changes to the policy regarding shoes. In 2016, Facebook leased space at another location in New York, giving the two divisions more breathing room to coexist, but at that moment in time, it was \"a clash of cultures,\" a former employee said. Facebook declined to comment. WATCH: A first look inside Facebook's epic headquarters expansion that includes a redwood forest and a botanical garden ", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (photo via StoryPick). Could Facebook Be Half Fakebook?Could Facebook (FB) be half fake? That was what was alleged in a report by PlainSite Thursday, which was picked up by Seeking Alpha and other sites. PlainSite argued that the situation at Facebook is worse than was commonly understood:Yet as bad as things have been of late for Facebook, with endless privacy breaches and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election hanging over Menlo Park like a spectre, we believe that the situation is far worse than investors realize. Facebook has been lying to the public about the scale of its problem with fake accounts, which likely exceed 50% of its network. Its official metrics\u2014many of which it has stopped reporting quarterly\u2014are self-contradictory and even farcical. The company has lost control of its own product.PlainSite detailed some consequences if 50% or more of Facebook's accounts are fake: Its customers purchase advertising on Facebook based on the fact that it can supposedly target advertisements at more than 2 billion real human beings. To the extent that users aren\u2019t real, companies are throwing their money down the drain. Fake accounts click on advertising at random, or \"like\" pages, to throw off anti-fraud algorithms. Fake accounts look real if they do not follow a clear pattern. This kind of activity defrauds advertisers, but rewards Facebook with revenue. Fake accounts often defraud other users on Facebook, through scams, fake news, extortion, and other forms of deception. Often, they can involve governments. PlainSite concluded that,it is increasingly likely that Facebook will go the way of AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy\u2014if legal liability doesn\u2019t bankrupt it first.PlainSite's calls for doom might seem surprising, given Facebook's bounce over the last month.But if you are concerned that PlainSite's bearish view may become predominant over the next several months, below are two ways you can stay long while limiting your risk.Limiting Your Risk In FacebookBefore I get to the hedges, a quick reminder: Hedging is for bulls who want to limit their risk. If you're bearish on Facebook, as PlainSite is now, you shouldn't be long the stock.With that said, for the examples below I have assumed you own 500 shares of Facebook and can tolerate a decline of 18% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 500 shares of FB against a &gt;18% decline by late June. The cost for this hedge was $2,200, or 3.02% of position value. This was calculated conservatively though, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell hedges at some point between the bid and ask prices.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 16%, this was the optimal collar to protect yourself against the same &gt;18% decline by late June.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}
{"tick": "FB", "headline": "Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings", "author": "Patti Domm", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html", "text": "The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks \u2014 Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth \u2014 but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. \"They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat \u2014 at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. \"This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,\" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. \"In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,\" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. \"I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,\" she said. \"In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.\" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. \"When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,\" Calvasina said. \"Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.\" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.\"The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,\" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. \"We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,\" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize.\" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, \"this stock could fly,\" Cramer said.

Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   \"I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,\" Cramer warned. \"That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back.\" But, he admitted, \"I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday].\" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: \"The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around.\" AT&amp;T: The \"Mad Money\" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. \"If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,\" Cramer said. \"He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings \u2014 that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful.\" Tesla: \"A boatload of controversy\" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. \"My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,\" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less \"inured to negativity at this point,\" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,\" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has \"been on fire of late,\" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a \"crowded\" day. \"We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,\" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. \"The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,\" he said. \"Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more.\" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a \"quandary\" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was \"getting too much advance attention from the bulls.\" The Amazon zealots are \"starting to squawk about an upside surprise,\" he said. \"That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it.\" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The \"remarkable rebound\" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. \"I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,\" he said. The \"Mad Money\" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. \"I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,\" he acknowledged. \"You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P.

The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. \"There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. \"If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,\" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an \"extreme remedy\" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. \"I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,\" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. \"My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.\" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. \"It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,\" Stamos said.

That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is \"not where the big money is,\" the longtime stock-picker explained. \"In this business, content is king,\" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,\" Cramer told viewers. \"World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps.\" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. \"She can have that opinion,\" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on \"Mad Money.\" \"I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.\"  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication \"in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.\"  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's \"earnings Super Bowl,\" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. \"It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,\" he said. \"Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype.\" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. \"In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,\" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is \"flirting with 3 percent,\" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. \"We can afford to wait this out. They can't,\" he said. \"So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: \"I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen.

Stone presumably favored WhatsApp because it's one of a very few services that offer \"end-to-end encryption\" on both messages and phone calls, as well as communications that include photographs and documents. This means messages sent via the platform are scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can view them on their respective devices, making it almost impossible for outsiders to monitor communications. Even the information about who's on the other end of the line is obscured from view, so outsiders can't easily scan carrier records or internet service provider records to discover that two parties were in touch. WhatsApp voice calls, which appear to be what Stone was allegedly proposing, are similarly encrypted. Somebody within earshot could hear the conversation, but the data making up the voices on the call are encrypted in transit, and prying parties trying to tap any line in between would likely be unable to monitor the scrambled content of the conversation. This may not work, however, if either party is running an old version of the application, so it's not foolproof. These features have made WhatsApp a favorite of many people who wish to keep their communications under an additional layer of privacy. They include criminals and terrorists \u2014 but also people who simply enjoy privacy, and even cybersecurity experts battling criminals. Security professionals often use applications like WhatsApp to communicate \"out of band\" \u2014 in other words, off official work channels \u2014 about investigations that they need to keep private internally. It's unclear from Stone's indictment whether any of the communications cited were actually conducted via WhatsApp or came from other channels. But even if WhatsApp had been used, the special counsel investigation so far has shown these communications are recoverable in some circumstances, as they apparently have for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. For instance, if somebody on either end of the conversation willingly gives up the information, or it's stored on a device that's not password-protected and belongs to one of the parties, then it's possible for an outsider to see what was discussed. Competitors in the encrypted communications space \u2014 including my favorites, Wickr and Signal \u2014 offer similar advantages with some added security benefits as well. For instance, Wickr lets you thoroughly destroy old messages and make encrypted video calls and voice memos, and Signal offers simple group messaging and lets you set a time limit on when to destroy messages. WhatsApp may face an uphill battle in continuing to appeal to those seeking heightened access to private communication channels, as Facebook links its other products to the application.

Engineering is the domain of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Sales is COO Sheryl Sandberg's. Engineers like to work comfortably and quietly. Sales is loud. Engineering is young and very male. Sales skews older and more diverse. Most engineers can go their entire Facebook careers without ever meeting a salesperson, while only the best sales employees take the time to build relationships with engineers (who can come in handy whenever a client runs into a technical problem). And in most of Facebook's offices, engineers and salespeople rarely interact. At the headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for example, the two work in completely separate buildings. But there are times when the two cultures clash. These clashes are rare, but highlight the tension Facebook faces every day: It must build products that users love and want to use, while simultaneously providing enough value to advertisers to keep the lights on.  One such clash came in 2015 at Facebook's New York offices, one of the most densely populated in the company. Although sales and engineering were kept on separate floors in New York, the two departments shared a common cafeteria. Facebook's New York sales employees often brought big clients into the office for visits, taking them to lunch while on their visits. In that same space, engineers flexed their predilection for comfort. \"Engineers were going to cafeteria without their shoes on, and a sales person wrote, 'Hey, we have clients. Please keep in mind this is a professional environment,'\" a former Facebook sales employee told CNBC. \"Everyone just treated it like a living room,\" said one former contractor. \"That's pretty much what they encouraged \u2026 you wouldn't bat an eye if someone was walking around in slippers or socks.\" \"It was bizarre,\" said another former contractor. The former sales employee recalled seeing engineers walk barefoot into the bathroom and then barefoot into the cafeteria. The salesperson's post caused \"a flare up\" on the company's internal social network and in the New York office, according to five former employees and contractors who remember the incident, now known as \"shoegate.\" Sales and engineering employees left hundreds of comments defending both sides of the shoeless debate, and debating which side of the company was more important. The crux of the debate came down to: engineers build the product, but the salespeople keep the lights on. Despite the battle of words, none of the former employees recall the company implementing any changes to the policy regarding shoes. In 2016, Facebook leased space at another location in New York, giving the two divisions more breathing room to coexist, but at that moment in time, it was \"a clash of cultures,\" a former employee said.

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (photo via StoryPick). Could Facebook Be Half Fakebook?Could Facebook (FB) be half fake? That was what was alleged in a report by PlainSite Thursday, which was picked up by Seeking Alpha and other sites. PlainSite argued that the situation at Facebook is worse than was commonly understood:Yet as bad as things have been of late for Facebook, with endless privacy breaches and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election hanging over Menlo Park like a spectre, we believe that the situation is far worse than investors realize. Facebook has been lying to the public about the scale of its problem with fake accounts, which likely exceed 50% of its network. Its official metrics\u2014many of which it has stopped reporting quarterly\u2014are self-contradictory and even farcical. The company has lost control of its own product.PlainSite detailed some consequences if 50% or more of Facebook's accounts are fake: Its customers purchase advertising on Facebook based on the fact that it can supposedly target advertisements at more than 2 billion real human beings. To the extent that users aren\u2019t real, companies are throwing their money down the drain. Fake accounts click on advertising at random, or \"like\" pages, to throw off anti-fraud algorithms. Fake accounts look real if they do not follow a clear pattern. This kind of activity defrauds advertisers, but rewards Facebook with revenue. Fake accounts often defraud other users on Facebook, through scams, fake news, extortion, and other forms of deception. Often, they can involve governments. PlainSite concluded that,it is increasingly likely that Facebook will go the way of AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy\u2014if legal liability doesn\u2019t bankrupt it first.PlainSite's calls for doom might seem surprising, given Facebook's bounce over the last month.But if you are concerned that PlainSite's bearish view may become predominant over the next several months, below are two ways you can stay long while limiting your risk.Limiting Your Risk In FacebookBefore I get to the hedges, a quick reminder: Hedging is for bulls who want to limit their risk. If you're bearish on Facebook, as PlainSite is now, you shouldn't be long the stock.With that said, for the examples below I have assumed you own 500 shares of Facebook and can tolerate a decline of 18% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 500 shares of FB against a &gt;18% decline by late June. The cost for this hedge was $2,200, or 3.02% of position value. This was calculated conservatively though, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell hedges at some point between the bid and ask prices.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 16%, this was the optimal collar to protect yourself against the same &gt;18% decline by late June.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks \u2014 Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth \u2014 but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. \"They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat \u2014 at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. \"This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,\" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. \"In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,\" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. \"I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,\" she said. \"In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.\" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. \"When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,\" Calvasina said. \"Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.\" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.\"The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,\" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. \"We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,\" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

The revenue estimate implies 26% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.Stagnant MAU GrowthFacebook's top line continues to show tremendous growth. I assumed that once its revenue got to a certain level that its growth would plateau. That moment has yet to arrive. Implied 26% revenue growth this quarter follows 33% growth in Q3. Operating income only grew 13% Y/Y as operating income margin fell to 42% from 50% in the year-earlier period. Facebook has increased investments in infrastructure, safety, and security in reaction to regulatory pressures. I find it difficult to believe the company cannot cut into these costs if revenue growth slows.Monthly active users (\"MAUs\") are already slowing. More than 2.6 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger each month, up from 2.5 billion in Q2 2018. This is a big selling point to advertisers; they can reach over 2 billion people with one advertising campaign. The question is, \"How do you value that pool of users?\" MAUs were 2.3 billion at Q3 2018, up 10% Y/Y and 2% sequentially. As the chart illustrates, MAU growth appeared to have plateaued in Q4 2017. The days of double-digit sequential growth in MAUs are a thing of the past. MAUs could come under further scrutiny after PlainSite alleged a massive number of Facebook's accounts are fake: Facebook shares have fallen in the past hour, giving up the day's gains, coinciding with a negative report from PlainSite alleging a massive number of fake accounts. PlainSite says more than 50% of Facebook's accounts are \"very likely fake.\" Moreover, PlainSite says the company is lying about is fake accounts, which would make it liable to its advertising customers for billions of dollars. That said, double-digit sequential growth in MAUs is a thing of the past. Will that alone dampen sentiment for the FB? I doubt it.FB bulls will likely look for any reason to keep buying the stock. The fact that revenue growth is still robust could give bulls hope. Revenue growth that exceeds MAU growth implies average revenue per user (\"ARPU\") is increasing. I understand MAUs for Instagram and WhatsApp are growing faster than overall MAUs. Facebook may be increasing ARPU for these revenue streams due to higher levels of engagement.WhatsApp and Instagram may be cannibalizing Facebook sales. They are also likely causing growth in daily active users (\"DAUs\") at Snapchat (SNAP) to stagnate. Facebook has scale (over 2 billion MAUs) and it also owns two of social media's fastest growing platforms (Instagram and WhatsApp). It could give the company more pricing power. ARPU could change the narrative and get investors to focus less on declining growth in MAUs.The Economy Is Showing CracksAt the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company. It sells ads to clients who want to access its massive user base. Regulators, particularly in Europe, are starting to set restraints on the company as it would on any other media outlet. I believe Facebook's revenue and earnings could get hit hard during the next economic downturn, just likely cyclical advertising and media outlets.The Federal Reserve is undoing some of the stimulus it provided over the past decade. Revenue growth at certain industrial giants is now slowing. General Electric's (GE) core Power business is being disrupted by alternative energy sources and Ford (F) is losing money in major markets outside North America. We will learn more about the earnings of 3M (MMM) and Honeywell (HON) next week. They could give us more clarity on whether the global economy is headed lower. If the economy falters (which I believe it will), it will likely tamp down large advertising campaigns by industrial giants and/or consumer brands. This would not be good for Facebook.", "source": "https://seekingalpha.com/"}

I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize.\" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, \"this stock could fly,\" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for \"shooting itself in the foot.\" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant \"one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,\" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. \"This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,\" he noted. \"I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock.\" Pfizer: The \"Mad Money\" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. \"It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,\" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   \"I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,\" Cramer warned. \"That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back.\" But, he admitted, \"I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday].\" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: \"The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around.\" AT&amp;T: The \"Mad Money\" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. \"If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,\" Cramer said. \"He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings \u2014 that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful.\" Tesla: \"A boatload of controversy\" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. \"My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,\" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less \"inured to negativity at this point,\" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,\" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has \"been on fire of late,\" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a \"crowded\" day. \"We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,\" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. \"The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,\" he said. \"Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more.\" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a \"quandary\" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was \"getting too much advance attention from the bulls.\" The Amazon zealots are \"starting to squawk about an upside surprise,\" he said. \"That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it.\" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The \"remarkable rebound\" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. \"I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,\" he said. The \"Mad Money\" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. \"I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,\" he acknowledged. \"You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}
{"tick": "FB", "headline": "UPDATE 2-Zuckerberg to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger -NYT", "author": "CNBC", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-update-2-zuckerberg-to-integrate-whatsapp-instagram-and-facebook-messenger-nyt.html", "text": "-NYT@ (Adds comment from former Facebook engineer and other researchers) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday. The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. \"There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,\" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. \"If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,\" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an \"extreme remedy\" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. \"I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,\" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. \"My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.\" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. \"It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,\" Stamos said.
