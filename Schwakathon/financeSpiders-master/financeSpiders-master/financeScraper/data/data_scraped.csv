0,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer Remix: WWE's subscription service has others following its lead,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramer-remix-wwes-subscription-service-has-others-following-its-lead.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,"" Cramer told viewers. ""World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps."" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook. ",AAPL
1,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
2,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

3,The Balance of Trade,"Market Volatility Bulletin: Equity Futures Rally In Pre-Market, Gain More Ground Into The Afternoon | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235689-market-volatility-bulletin-equity-futures-rally-pre-market-gain-ground-afternoon?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe Fed tapering QT would likely be perceived by markets as a strong positive.VXX is maturing, and VXXB will soon take its place. It may be a good idea to sit things out until the new product has had a chance to season.It's reasonable to keep an eye on the VIX of NASDAQ, as names in the tech space caused so much of last quarter's carnage.Market Intro Wall St. Journal CNBC: 1:28 PM ESTInvestors continued to feed the stock market rally, now in its fifth week for US stocks (SPY, DIA, QQQ, IWM). The reading on spot VIX is now just half what it was just before Christmas. We saw a decent dip this week, but investors are doing a decent job of shrugging off Tuesday and treating the repricing of that day as a one-off.News that the Fed may be actively considering and even ready to communicate a willingness to taper QT may well have added to higher prices this morning.In both October and November, and to a lesser extent in March and April, S&amp;P 2666 acted as a base of support. I wonder if the level now begins to act as resistance.Thoughts on Volatility Tech titans really took their toll on the markets last quarter. Indeed, it was the push higher in tech and small caps last May that signaled the all-clear for US equity risk for the next few months.Now, large tech names (AAPL, FB) are very far from their highs, and it seems to me more likely that the price action for these tickers would be more inclined to follow than lead the market higher, given the extent of the damage investors in these companies suffered last quarter. A pioneer in its day, VXX is near ready for retirement. The maturing ETN will be replaced by VXXB. It may be worthwhile to hold back on trading either the old instrument or the new until the market irons out any possible wrinkles that may accompany the transition. Yesterday turned out to be a quiet day in the options markets. The corresponding calm in stocks (i.e. low realized vol) takes some wind out of the sails of spot VIX' likely trading range. Tuesday's drop in the S&amp;P didn't do much for spot VIX (just shy of 22), and even that gain has quickly died down.",AAPL

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

The stock traded as high as $158.13, briefly topping the $157.92 closing price on Jan. 2. After the market's close that day, Apple said sales for its fiscal first quarter would likely fall short of expectations due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and headwinds in China. Apple lost 10 percent of its market value the day after the announcement, marking the stock's steepest one-day drop since 2013. Shares closed at $157.76 Friday.  Even with the recent bounce, it's been a particularly rough few months for Apple investors.

6,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.""

9,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Additionally, Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast and Disney. ",AAPL

Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday.

""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to.""

14,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

17,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
18,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

19,The Balance of Trade,"Market Volatility Bulletin: Equity Futures Rally In Pre-Market, Gain More Ground Into The Afternoon | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235689-market-volatility-bulletin-equity-futures-rally-pre-market-gain-ground-afternoon?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe Fed tapering QT would likely be perceived by markets as a strong positive.VXX is maturing, and VXXB will soon take its place. It may be a good idea to sit things out until the new product has had a chance to season.It's reasonable to keep an eye on the VIX of NASDAQ, as names in the tech space caused so much of last quarter's carnage.Market Intro Wall St. Journal CNBC: 1:28 PM ESTInvestors continued to feed the stock market rally, now in its fifth week for US stocks (SPY, DIA, QQQ, IWM). The reading on spot VIX is now just half what it was just before Christmas. We saw a decent dip this week, but investors are doing a decent job of shrugging off Tuesday and treating the repricing of that day as a one-off.News that the Fed may be actively considering and even ready to communicate a willingness to taper QT may well have added to higher prices this morning.In both October and November, and to a lesser extent in March and April, S&amp;P 2666 acted as a base of support. I wonder if the level now begins to act as resistance.Thoughts on Volatility Tech titans really took their toll on the markets last quarter. Indeed, it was the push higher in tech and small caps last May that signaled the all-clear for US equity risk for the next few months.Now, large tech names (AAPL, FB) are very far from their highs, and it seems to me more likely that the price action for these tickers would be more inclined to follow than lead the market higher, given the extent of the damage investors in these companies suffered last quarter. A pioneer in its day, VXX is near ready for retirement. The maturing ETN will be replaced by VXXB. It may be worthwhile to hold back on trading either the old instrument or the new until the market irons out any possible wrinkles that may accompany the transition. Yesterday turned out to be a quiet day in the options markets. The corresponding calm in stocks (i.e. low realized vol) takes some wind out of the sails of spot VIX' likely trading range. Tuesday's drop in the S&amp;P didn't do much for spot VIX (just shy of 22), and even that gain has quickly died down.",AAPL
20,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ",AAPL
21,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Additionally, Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast and Disney. ",AAPL

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""

27,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

28,Josephine Mason,UPDATE 2-Risk-on shift sends European shares near 2-month highs,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-update-2-risk-on-shift-sends-european-shares-near-2-month-highs.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"* Hopes in dovish Fed * Tech optimism continues * Market shrugs off negative German data * Vodafone hits July 2010 lows after trading update (Adds closing prices) LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - European shares on Friday hit their highest level in nearly two months as positive earnings, hopes of accommodative U.S. monetary policies and higher oil and metal prices help fuel a global rally. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

The stock traded as high as $158.13, briefly topping the $157.92 closing price on Jan. 2. After the market's close that day, Apple said sales for its fiscal first quarter would likely fall short of expectations due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and headwinds in China. Apple lost 10 percent of its market value the day after the announcement, marking the stock's steepest one-day drop since 2013. Shares closed at $157.76 Friday.  Even with the recent bounce, it's been a particularly rough few months for Apple investors. The company, which became the first in the U.S. to reach a $1 trillion stock market value, has seen its shares drop 32 percent from its record high in October. Apple reports first-quarter results next week. WATCH: Tim Cook teases new Apple services to come in 2019 Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",AAPL
30,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
31,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

32,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.""

33,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said.

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook. ",AAPL
39,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

The stock traded as high as $158.13, briefly topping the $157.92 closing price on Jan. 2. After the market's close that day, Apple said sales for its fiscal first quarter would likely fall short of expectations due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and headwinds in China. Apple lost 10 percent of its market value the day after the announcement, marking the stock's steepest one-day drop since 2013. Shares closed at $157.76 Friday.  Even with the recent bounce, it's been a particularly rough few months for Apple investors. The company, which became the first in the U.S. to reach a $1 trillion stock market value, has seen its shares drop 32 percent from its record high in October.

42,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
43,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.""

45,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix.

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,"" Cramer told viewers. ""World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps."" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game.

51,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
52,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The reading on spot VIX is now just half what it was just before Christmas. We saw a decent dip this week, but investors are doing a decent job of shrugging off Tuesday and treating the repricing of that day as a one-off.News that the Fed may be actively considering and even ready to communicate a willingness to taper QT may well have added to higher prices this morning.In both October and November, and to a lesser extent in March and April, S&amp;P 2666 acted as a base of support. I wonder if the level now begins to act as resistance.Thoughts on Volatility Tech titans really took their toll on the markets last quarter. Indeed, it was the push higher in tech and small caps last May that signaled the all-clear for US equity risk for the next few months.Now, large tech names (AAPL, FB) are very far from their highs, and it seems to me more likely that the price action for these tickers would be more inclined to follow than lead the market higher, given the extent of the damage investors in these companies suffered last quarter. A pioneer in its day, VXX is near ready for retirement. The maturing ETN will be replaced by VXXB. It may be worthwhile to hold back on trading either the old instrument or the new until the market irons out any possible wrinkles that may accompany the transition. Yesterday turned out to be a quiet day in the options markets. The corresponding calm in stocks (i.e. low realized vol) takes some wind out of the sails of spot VIX' likely trading range.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

56,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

57,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ",AAPL

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said.

Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""

""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good.

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

(NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
68,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

It may be a good idea to sit things out until the new product has had a chance to season.It's reasonable to keep an eye on the VIX of NASDAQ, as names in the tech space caused so much of last quarter's carnage.Market Intro Wall St. Journal CNBC: 1:28 PM ESTInvestors continued to feed the stock market rally, now in its fifth week for US stocks (SPY, DIA, QQQ, IWM). The reading on spot VIX is now just half what it was just before Christmas. We saw a decent dip this week, but investors are doing a decent job of shrugging off Tuesday and treating the repricing of that day as a one-off.News that the Fed may be actively considering and even ready to communicate a willingness to taper QT may well have added to higher prices this morning.In both October and November, and to a lesser extent in March and April, S&amp;P 2666 acted as a base of support. I wonder if the level now begins to act as resistance.Thoughts on Volatility Tech titans really took their toll on the markets last quarter. Indeed, it was the push higher in tech and small caps last May that signaled the all-clear for US equity risk for the next few months.Now, large tech names (AAPL, FB) are very far from their highs, and it seems to me more likely that the price action for these tickers would be more inclined to follow than lead the market higher, given the extent of the damage investors in these companies suffered last quarter. A pioneer in its day, VXX is near ready for retirement. The maturing ETN will be replaced by VXXB. It may be worthwhile to hold back on trading either the old instrument or the new until the market irons out any possible wrinkles that may accompany the transition. Yesterday turned out to be a quiet day in the options markets. The corresponding calm in stocks (i.e. low realized vol) takes some wind out of the sails of spot VIX' likely trading range. Tuesday's drop in the S&amp;P didn't do much for spot VIX (just shy of 22), and even that gain has quickly died down.",AAPL
70,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ",AAPL
71,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Additionally, Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast and Disney. ",AAPL

Eisenstein Apple dismissed just over 200 employees this week from Project Titan, its stealthy autonomous vehicle group, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. An Apple spokesperson acknowledged the layoffs and said the company still sees opportunity in the space: ""We have an incredibly talented team working on autonomous systems and associated technologies at Apple. As the team focuses their work on several key areas for 2019, some groups are being moved to projects in other parts of the company, where they will support machine learning and other initiatives, across all of Apple,"" the spokesperson said. ""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""

What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said.

77,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

The stock traded as high as $158.13, briefly topping the $157.92 closing price on Jan. 2. After the market's close that day, Apple said sales for its fiscal first quarter would likely fall short of expectations due to weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and headwinds in China. Apple lost 10 percent of its market value the day after the announcement, marking the stock's steepest one-day drop since 2013. Shares closed at $157.76 Friday.  Even with the recent bounce, it's been a particularly rough few months for Apple investors. The company, which became the first in the U.S. to reach a $1 trillion stock market value, has seen its shares drop 32 percent from its record high in October.

80,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
81,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some.""

83,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said.

""We continue to believe there is a huge opportunity with autonomous systems, that Apple has unique capabilities to contribute, and that this is the most ambitious machine learning project ever."" In August, Apple enlisted a Tesla engineering vice president and Apple veteran, Doug Field, to lead the Titan team alongside Bob Mansfield. This week's dismissals from the group were seen internally as anticipated restructuring under the relatively new leadership. Other employees who were impacted by the restructuring of Project Titan are staying at Apple, but moving to different parts of the company. CEO Tim Cook has been touting Apple's initiatives in health as the key to its future. ""I believe, if you zoom out into the future, and you look back, and you ask the question, 'What was Apple's greatest contribution to mankind?' it will be about health,"" Cook told CNBC's Jim Cramer. Apple executives have been mum in recent months about the company's car prospects, which appear to have been scaled back from the initial rumored vehicle to a focus on software. In 2016, Apple laid off employees from the same group, shifting its strategy. Fully self-driving cars remain experimental, even for major players in the field such as Waymo, Cruise and Tesla. Venture and strategic investors from the traditional automotive world have poured billions into start-ups developing self-driving vehicles including Zoox, Pony.AI, Aurora, May Mobility and Embark. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,"" Cramer told viewers. ""World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps."" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game. No one's looking out for the little guy and it's driving me crazy."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast, Disney and Facebook. ",AAPL
89,Stone Fox Capital,Qualcomm: Not So Excessive - Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235682-qualcomm-excessive?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryQualcomm dips to $50 based ongoing FTC lawsuit and major short call.Apple can't prove harm from paying high royalty rates to Qualcomm based on massive profits from the iPhone.The wireless tech giant doesn't charge excessive royalty rates as claimed.The FTC lawsuit outcome is unknown, but the case hasn't been made for lower royalty rates.A big part of the current weakness in Qualcomm (QCOM) is market fears that the wireless technology company might lose the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit. The short thesis is that losing the lawsuit will decimate the royalty business, though countless lawsuits in places like China and South Korea failed to make anything other than minor adjustments to royalty rates. Image Source: FTC websiteFTC TrialThe FTC trial in the US District in San Jose claims that Qualcomm had a monopoly on modem chips and harmed competition while hurting consumers via higher phone prices caused by ""excessive"" royalty fees. Finding the consumer harm or monopoly impact on device makers like Apple (AAPL) are very difficult. The big focus of the case is on competitive harm via the ""no license, no chips"" policy.A big part of the FTC trial is whether Qualcomm should license their modem technology to competitors like Intel (INTC) and only charge ""fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) rates on the modem value, not the price of the mobile device. A lot of bears on Qualcomm are pointing to this exchange in the trial (via FOSS Patents). During this trial, some Qualcomm-internal communications have been shown according to which Qualcomm's management always feared that licenses to rival chipset makers would have a devastating effect on Qualcomm's patent licensing business. Here's an interesting passage (just recently unsealed) from the FTC's trial brief: ""Qualcomm's internal documents recognize the impact that offering competitors FRAND licenses would have on Qualcomm's ability to secure elevated royalties from OEMs. In 2005, Qualcomm's Marvin Blecker explained that making a license available to a chip competitor would impair Qualcomm's ability to collect high royalties from OEM customers: 'we absolutely cannot give a chip supplier a full license to our IP with pass through rights to his customers as that would have the potential of severely impacting our subscriber licensing program.' [...] Qualcomm's views were unchanged in 2015, when it concluded that granting a FRAND license to Intel 'would destroy the whole current QTL [licensing] business.'"" In essence, Qualcomm doesn't want to run into patent exhaustion by charging royalties on a $20 chip versus a $400 device. The other issue is that Qualcomm is selling a license for patents that go far in excess of just technology for patents (via Cnet). Per CEO Mollenkopf:We only sell to companies with a license because not all the IP [intellectual property] is covered in the chip. What we want to do is make sure the [phone makers] are covered. It's not embodied in the chip, it's not in the phones, but it's in all these things. There's a tremendous amount of IP we generate that makes the system work.The question that doesn't appeared resolved in this case is what the difference is in paying a license fee for the modems separate and the other patents along with the device. Qualcomm doesn't like the concept of the device maker being able to obtain modem chips without paying the full royalty rate upfront, but Apple is doing that exact procedure with current iPhones using Intel chips.This move seems to discredit the concept that Qualcomm has a monopoly for any other reason then having the best technology in the wireless sector. According to Forbes contributor Kevin Krewell of TIRIAS Research, it makes no sense for Intel to pay for a license when the device manufacturer has already paid for the related patents:Qualcomm’s policy was to not provide exhaustive licenses to competitors (chip makers), because the royalty for all applicable patents was already accounted for and paid by handset OEMs. It’s hard to understand the FTC’s contention, that not licensing competing chipmakers was a barrier to entry, when they could already use Qualcomm’s technology IP for free (because handset OEMs paid the royalty). How would paying royalties to Qualcomm for cellular SEPs help Intel or Mediatek make reduce their costs and improve their margins?Royalties Aren't ExcessiveThe odd part about the FTC trial and the Apple lawsuit is the concept that Qualcomm is charging excessive royalties and using the related patents to keep competition at bay. The interesting part of this case is that Apple can't actually justify this case based on what other 5G technology standards partners are charging for the use of their patents.",AAPL
90,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended the day up 0.6 percent near two-month highs, scored a fourth straight week of gain and was on course for its best month since October 2015. Frankfurt's DAX was the top performer with a 1.4 percent rise while Britain's exporter-heavy FTSE 100 underperformed as a stronger sterling weighed. Traders cited a Wall Street Journal report which said Federal Reserve officials were considering maintaining a larger portfolio of Treasury securities than earlier expected as a reason for better risk sentiment. ""Economic sentiment has been deteriorating for a while now but the difference between now and December is that central banks are reacting to it,"" said Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet. ""That's what is leading to this improving risk tone,"" he argued, adding that ""the risk of unwarranted tightening of conditions is lower."" Investors also shrugged off a key German business morale indicator highlighting the deteriorating health of the euro zone. The European tech sector hit its highest level since Nov. 12 after an overnight chipmakers' rally on Wall Street led by higher than expected results in the sector. The sector has been hit hard by fears about stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy after sales warnings from Apple, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor earlier this month. Car makers and parts suppliers, which are sensitive to trade frictions and the health of the Chinese economy, were also strong performers, up 2.3 percent. Telecoms were among the few sectors in the red after disappointing results from Vodafone and Nordic telecom group Telia. Vodafone was down 4.9 percent, hitting its lowest in nearly nine years after the world's second-largest mobile operator said revenue growth slowed in the third quarter due to ongoing price competition in Spain and Italy and a slowdown in South Africa. The stock was knocked hard on Thursday after its South African unit issued disappointing results. Telia was down 4.6 percent, at the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its weaker-than-expected results.

94,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.

96,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's favorite ways to invest in the rise of streaming services,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-favorite-ways-to-invest-in-the-rise-of-streaming-services.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Investors looking to seize on the rise of over-the-top streaming services and increased cord-cutting should look no further than a few key stocks, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday on ""Mad Money."" While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said. That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. In 2017, Disney became something of a ""poster child for the pain of cord-cutting"" as Wall Street fretted about the company's subscriber losses at its sports network, ESPN, quarter after quarter. Since then, Disney CEO Bob Iger has been at work reshaping Disney's offerings, introducing ESPN+, an over-the-top streaming service with live sports and exclusive content, for $4.99 a month, last April. Still on the horizon for the company, which owns a stake in Hulu, is the launch of its own streaming service, Disney+. ""And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said. ""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."" The ""Mad Money"" host couldn't address streaming without considering the stock of Netflix, one of the pioneers of over-the-top offerings. But while he liked Netflix's long-term prospects, he worried about the stock's surge in recent weeks. ""Call me a believer, but understand that if you buy the stock here, you are chasing, and I am a no-chaser guy,"" he said. Cramer acknowledged that some investors might want to play it safer and invest in Apple, Amazon or Alphabet, whose streaming offerings are generally ""too small to move the needle,"" but remain solid lines of business. Some stock-pickers might want to speculate on a riskier play like Roku, or a ""dark horse"" like Comcast, which just began offering a new over-the-top interface, he said. But his favorites remain the stocks of Disney and, in the case of a pullback, the original streamer, Netflix. ""You've seen the rise of all these streaming services, so if you want to invest in the over-the-top renaissance, I say wait for a pullback in Netflix or pick up some Disney ahead of that all-important April analyst meeting,"" he said. Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. Additionally, Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Comcast and Disney. ",AAPL

Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday.

The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game.

1,Patti Domm,"Apple, Microsoft and Amazon could drive the market in the next wave of earnings",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/apple-microsoft-and-amazon-are-in-the-next-wave-of-earnings-.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead. Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

3,CNBC,"UPDATE 2-Zuckerberg to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger -NYT",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-update-2-zuckerberg-to-integrate-whatsapp-instagram-and-facebook-messenger-nyt.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"-NYT@ (Adds comment from former Facebook engineer and other researchers) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday. The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. ""There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,"" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ""If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,"" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an ""extreme remedy"" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. ""I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,"" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. ""My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption."" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. ""It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,"" Stamos said.

4,Kate Fazzini,Roger Stone allegedly wanted to use Facebook WhatsApp 'secure line',https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/roger-stone-allegedly-wanted-to-use-facebook-whatsapp-secure-line.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"On the same day Facebook has said it will expand its WhatsApp messaging product to include Facebook and Instagram, the popular encrypted messaging service got endorsed by an unlikely source: Roger Stone. ""Want to talk on a secure line — got Whatsapp?"" Stone asked a Trump campaign supporter in October 2016, before allegedly telling the supporter about forthcoming damaging material on Hillary Clinton, according to an indictment released Friday. Stone presumably favored WhatsApp because it's one of a very few services that offer ""end-to-end encryption"" on both messages and phone calls, as well as communications that include photographs and documents. This means messages sent via the platform are scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can view them on their respective devices, making it almost impossible for outsiders to monitor communications. Even the information about who's on the other end of the line is obscured from view, so outsiders can't easily scan carrier records or internet service provider records to discover that two parties were in touch. WhatsApp voice calls, which appear to be what Stone was allegedly proposing, are similarly encrypted. Somebody within earshot could hear the conversation, but the data making up the voices on the call are encrypted in transit, and prying parties trying to tap any line in between would likely be unable to monitor the scrambled content of the conversation. This may not work, however, if either party is running an old version of the application, so it's not foolproof. These features have made WhatsApp a favorite of many people who wish to keep their communications under an additional layer of privacy. They include criminals and terrorists — but also people who simply enjoy privacy, and even cybersecurity experts battling criminals. Security professionals often use applications like WhatsApp to communicate ""out of band"" — in other words, off official work channels — about investigations that they need to keep private internally. It's unclear from Stone's indictment whether any of the communications cited were actually conducted via WhatsApp or came from other channels. But even if WhatsApp had been used, the special counsel investigation so far has shown these communications are recoverable in some circumstances, as they apparently have for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. For instance, if somebody on either end of the conversation willingly gives up the information, or it's stored on a device that's not password-protected and belongs to one of the parties, then it's possible for an outsider to see what was discussed. Competitors in the encrypted communications space — including my favorites, Wickr and Signal — offer similar advantages with some added security benefits as well. For instance, Wickr lets you thoroughly destroy old messages and make encrypted video calls and voice memos, and Signal offers simple group messaging and lets you set a time limit on when to destroy messages. WhatsApp may face an uphill battle in continuing to appeal to those seeking heightened access to private communication channels, as Facebook links its other products to the application. ",FB

The reading on spot VIX is now just half what it was just before Christmas. We saw a decent dip this week, but investors are doing a decent job of shrugging off Tuesday and treating the repricing of that day as a one-off.News that the Fed may be actively considering and even ready to communicate a willingness to taper QT may well have added to higher prices this morning.In both October and November, and to a lesser extent in March and April, S&amp;P 2666 acted as a base of support. I wonder if the level now begins to act as resistance.Thoughts on Volatility Tech titans really took their toll on the markets last quarter. Indeed, it was the push higher in tech and small caps last May that signaled the all-clear for US equity risk for the next few months.Now, large tech names (AAPL, FB) are very far from their highs, and it seems to me more likely that the price action for these tickers would be more inclined to follow than lead the market higher, given the extent of the damage investors in these companies suffered last quarter. A pioneer in its day, VXX is near ready for retirement. The maturing ETN will be replaced by VXXB. It may be worthwhile to hold back on trading either the old instrument or the new until the market irons out any possible wrinkles that may accompany the transition. Yesterday turned out to be a quiet day in the options markets. The corresponding calm in stocks (i.e. low realized vol) takes some wind out of the sails of spot VIX' likely trading range.

Engineering is the domain of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Sales is COO Sheryl Sandberg's. Engineers like to work comfortably and quietly. Sales is loud. Engineering is young and very male. Sales skews older and more diverse. Most engineers can go their entire Facebook careers without ever meeting a salesperson, while only the best sales employees take the time to build relationships with engineers (who can come in handy whenever a client runs into a technical problem). And in most of Facebook's offices, engineers and salespeople rarely interact. At the headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for example, the two work in completely separate buildings. But there are times when the two cultures clash. These clashes are rare, but highlight the tension Facebook faces every day: It must build products that users love and want to use, while simultaneously providing enough value to advertisers to keep the lights on.  One such clash came in 2015 at Facebook's New York offices, one of the most densely populated in the company. Although sales and engineering were kept on separate floors in New York, the two departments shared a common cafeteria. Facebook's New York sales employees often brought big clients into the office for visits, taking them to lunch while on their visits. In that same space, engineers flexed their predilection for comfort. ""Engineers were going to cafeteria without their shoes on, and a sales person wrote, 'Hey, we have clients.

""That's pretty much what they encouraged … you wouldn't bat an eye if someone was walking around in slippers or socks."" ""It was bizarre,"" said another former contractor. The former sales employee recalled seeing engineers walk barefoot into the bathroom and then barefoot into the cafeteria. The salesperson's post caused ""a flare up"" on the company's internal social network and in the New York office, according to five former employees and contractors who remember the incident, now known as ""shoegate."" Sales and engineering employees left hundreds of comments defending both sides of the shoeless debate, and debating which side of the company was more important. The crux of the debate came down to: engineers build the product, but the salespeople keep the lights on. Despite the battle of words, none of the former employees recall the company implementing any changes to the policy regarding shoes. In 2016, Facebook leased space at another location in New York, giving the two divisions more breathing room to coexist, but at that moment in time, it was ""a clash of cultures,"" a former employee said.

While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,"" Cramer told viewers. ""World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps."" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday. Click here to watch and read more about Sloan's interview. The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good.

12,Shock Exchange,Facebook Q4 Earnings: What You Need To Know - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235680-facebook-q4-earnings-need-know?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryFB reports quarterly earnings next week.MAU growth is slowing.A decline in corporate ad spending could sting by the second half of 2019.Sell FB. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Source: ForbesFacebook (FB) reports quarterly earnings on January 30th. Analysts expect revenue of $16.4 billion and EPS of $2.19. The revenue estimate implies 26% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.Stagnant MAU GrowthFacebook's top line continues to show tremendous growth. I assumed that once its revenue got to a certain level that its growth would plateau. That moment has yet to arrive. Implied 26% revenue growth this quarter follows 33% growth in Q3. Operating income only grew 13% Y/Y as operating income margin fell to 42% from 50% in the year-earlier period. Facebook has increased investments in infrastructure, safety, and security in reaction to regulatory pressures. I find it difficult to believe the company cannot cut into these costs if revenue growth slows.Monthly active users (""MAUs"") are already slowing. More than 2.6 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger each month, up from 2.5 billion in Q2 2018. This is a big selling point to advertisers; they can reach over 2 billion people with one advertising campaign. The question is, ""How do you value that pool of users?"" MAUs were 2.3 billion at Q3 2018, up 10% Y/Y and 2% sequentially. As the chart illustrates, MAU growth appeared to have plateaued in Q4 2017. The days of double-digit sequential growth in MAUs are a thing of the past. MAUs could come under further scrutiny after PlainSite alleged a massive number of Facebook's accounts are fake: Facebook shares have fallen in the past hour, giving up the day's gains, coinciding with a negative report from PlainSite alleging a massive number of fake accounts. PlainSite says more than 50% of Facebook's accounts are ""very likely fake."" Moreover, PlainSite says the company is lying about is fake accounts, which would make it liable to its advertising customers for billions of dollars. That said, double-digit sequential growth in MAUs is a thing of the past. Will that alone dampen sentiment for the FB? I doubt it.FB bulls will likely look for any reason to keep buying the stock. The fact that revenue growth is still robust could give bulls hope. Revenue growth that exceeds MAU growth implies average revenue per user (""ARPU"") is increasing. I understand MAUs for Instagram and WhatsApp are growing faster than overall MAUs. Facebook may be increasing ARPU for these revenue streams due to higher levels of engagement.WhatsApp and Instagram may be cannibalizing Facebook sales. They are also likely causing growth in daily active users (""DAUs"") at Snapchat (SNAP) to stagnate. Facebook has scale (over 2 billion MAUs) and it also owns two of social media's fastest growing platforms (Instagram and WhatsApp). It could give the company more pricing power. ARPU could change the narrative and get investors to focus less on declining growth in MAUs.The Economy Is Showing CracksAt the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company. It sells ads to clients who want to access its massive user base. Regulators, particularly in Europe, are starting to set restraints on the company as it would on any other media outlet. I believe Facebook's revenue and earnings could get hit hard during the next economic downturn, just likely cyclical advertising and media outlets.The Federal Reserve is undoing some of the stimulus it provided over the past decade. Revenue growth at certain industrial giants is now slowing. General Electric's (GE) core Power business is being disrupted by alternative energy sources and Ford (F) is losing money in major markets outside North America. We will learn more about the earnings of 3M (MMM) and Honeywell (HON) next week. They could give us more clarity on whether the global economy is headed lower. If the economy falters (which I believe it will), it will likely tamp down large advertising campaigns by industrial giants and/or consumer brands. This would not be good for Facebook.",FB

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (photo via StoryPick). Could Facebook Be Half Fakebook?Could Facebook (FB) be half fake? That was what was alleged in a report by PlainSite Thursday, which was picked up by Seeking Alpha and other sites. PlainSite argued that the situation at Facebook is worse than was commonly understood:Yet as bad as things have been of late for Facebook, with endless privacy breaches and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election hanging over Menlo Park like a spectre, we believe that the situation is far worse than investors realize. Facebook has been lying to the public about the scale of its problem with fake accounts, which likely exceed 50% of its network. Its official metrics—many of which it has stopped reporting quarterly—are self-contradictory and even farcical. The company has lost control of its own product.PlainSite detailed some consequences if 50% or more of Facebook's accounts are fake: Its customers purchase advertising on Facebook based on the fact that it can supposedly target advertisements at more than 2 billion real human beings. To the extent that users aren’t real, companies are throwing their money down the drain. Fake accounts click on advertising at random, or ""like"" pages, to throw off anti-fraud algorithms. Fake accounts look real if they do not follow a clear pattern. This kind of activity defrauds advertisers, but rewards Facebook with revenue. Fake accounts often defraud other users on Facebook, through scams, fake news, extortion, and other forms of deception. Often, they can involve governments. PlainSite concluded that,it is increasingly likely that Facebook will go the way of AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy—if legal liability doesn’t bankrupt it first.PlainSite's calls for doom might seem surprising, given Facebook's bounce over the last month.But if you are concerned that PlainSite's bearish view may become predominant over the next several months, below are two ways you can stay long while limiting your risk.Limiting Your Risk In FacebookBefore I get to the hedges, a quick reminder: Hedging is for bulls who want to limit their risk. If you're bearish on Facebook, as PlainSite is now, you shouldn't be long the stock.With that said, for the examples below I have assumed you own 500 shares of Facebook and can tolerate a decline of 18% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 500 shares of FB against a &gt;18% decline by late June. The cost for this hedge was $2,200, or 3.02% of position value. This was calculated conservatively though, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell hedges at some point between the bid and ask prices.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 16%, this was the optimal collar to protect yourself against the same &gt;18% decline by late June.",FB

Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall.

Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action.

17,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ",FB
18,CNBC,"UPDATE 2-Zuckerberg to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger -NYT",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-update-2-zuckerberg-to-integrate-whatsapp-instagram-and-facebook-messenger-nyt.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"-NYT@ (Adds comment from former Facebook engineer and other researchers) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday. The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. ""There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,"" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ""If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,"" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an ""extreme remedy"" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. ""I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,"" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. ""My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption."" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. ""It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,"" Stamos said.

While the devices and ecosystems that enable streaming — think Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Comcast, as well as smaller players like Roku — are worth considering for some exposure, the streaming service providers are the real long-term winners, he said.   That's because, when it comes to over-the-top entertainment, the hardware is ""not where the big money is,"" the longtime stock-picker explained. ""In this business, content is king,"" he said. Cramer's favorite pick in the streaming space might come as a surprise: The Walt Disney Company. But there are other surprising winners, too, including World Wrestling Entertainment, which has become something of a pioneer in its niche sports-broadcasting industry, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""The truth is, tons of companies are getting into the over-the-top space,"" Cramer told viewers. ""World Wrestling Entertainment has an incredibly successful subscription streaming service and the stock's given us some gigantic gains, nearly quadrupling over the past 18 months or so. WWE got it right and now other sports organizations are following in their footsteps."" Click here for some other ways to play the rise of streaming. Wells Fargo President and CEO Tim Sloan responded Friday to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's repeated calls for his firing after a 2016 scandal in an interview on CNBC. ""She can have that opinion,"" Sloan, a frequent target of the Massachusetts senator and longtime Wall Street watchdog, told Cramer on ""Mad Money."" ""I think, if I'm not doing my job, as opposed to someone having an opinion about me that isn't always an informed opinion, then, of course, it would be appropriate that I'm not in this role.""  Warren, who is exploring the idea of a 2020 bid for president, asked the Federal Reserve in October to maintain its growth cap on Wells Fargo until the bank fires Sloan for his implication ""in the bank's repeated and egregious misconduct.""  Still, Sloan argued that he was the best man for the CEO job. He also explained how Wells Fargo is helping customers who have been affected by the government shutdown, which President Donald Trump temporarily ended on Friday.

The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains.

""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer turned to his game plan for the week ahead, which will see earnings reports from Apple, Tesla, Facebook, General Electric, Amazon and more. Click here for his full game plan. It's becoming increasingly clear that China has much more to lose than the United States in the countries' ongoing trade war, Cramer argued Friday. ""In the long run, it'll be cheaper for them to come to the table and give President Trump the concessions he wants,"" he argued. What makes him so sure is that, stacked side by side, the Chinese and U.S. economies are in very different places. China's unemployment rate is headed towards the 5 percent level, whereas the United States' is ""flirting with 3 percent,"" he said. The Chinese economy has slowed dramatically, while U.S. weekly jobless claims are at their lowest levels in decades. The bottom line? From Cramer's perspective, it seems like China will eventually have to come to the table. ""We can afford to wait this out. They can't,"" he said. ""So there should be a lot more hope that the Chinese will give in. Sooner or later, they have to."" In Cramer's lightning round, he raced through his responses to callers' favorite stocks: Comscore Inc.: ""I think that this is a pyrrhic victory that they've had versus Nielsen. I don't want to touch it. It doesn't have the growth I need."" E-Trade Financial Corp.: ""I think it's good. I do lament – I did a piece earlier this week about the day before Christmas and how there was just another annihilation in the stock market and more individual investors left, which makes it tougher for me to recommend any of these stocks because there are no refs in our game.

24,Kate Fazzini,Roger Stone allegedly wanted to use Facebook WhatsApp 'secure line',https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/roger-stone-allegedly-wanted-to-use-facebook-whatsapp-secure-line.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"On the same day Facebook has said it will expand its WhatsApp messaging product to include Facebook and Instagram, the popular encrypted messaging service got endorsed by an unlikely source: Roger Stone. ""Want to talk on a secure line — got Whatsapp?"" Stone asked a Trump campaign supporter in October 2016, before allegedly telling the supporter about forthcoming damaging material on Hillary Clinton, according to an indictment released Friday. Stone presumably favored WhatsApp because it's one of a very few services that offer ""end-to-end encryption"" on both messages and phone calls, as well as communications that include photographs and documents. This means messages sent via the platform are scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can view them on their respective devices, making it almost impossible for outsiders to monitor communications. Even the information about who's on the other end of the line is obscured from view, so outsiders can't easily scan carrier records or internet service provider records to discover that two parties were in touch. WhatsApp voice calls, which appear to be what Stone was allegedly proposing, are similarly encrypted. Somebody within earshot could hear the conversation, but the data making up the voices on the call are encrypted in transit, and prying parties trying to tap any line in between would likely be unable to monitor the scrambled content of the conversation. This may not work, however, if either party is running an old version of the application, so it's not foolproof. These features have made WhatsApp a favorite of many people who wish to keep their communications under an additional layer of privacy. They include criminals and terrorists — but also people who simply enjoy privacy, and even cybersecurity experts battling criminals. Security professionals often use applications like WhatsApp to communicate ""out of band"" — in other words, off official work channels — about investigations that they need to keep private internally. It's unclear from Stone's indictment whether any of the communications cited were actually conducted via WhatsApp or came from other channels. But even if WhatsApp had been used, the special counsel investigation so far has shown these communications are recoverable in some circumstances, as they apparently have for Michael Cohen and Paul Manafort. For instance, if somebody on either end of the conversation willingly gives up the information, or it's stored on a device that's not password-protected and belongs to one of the parties, then it's possible for an outsider to see what was discussed. Competitors in the encrypted communications space — including my favorites, Wickr and Signal — offer similar advantages with some added security benefits as well. For instance, Wickr lets you thoroughly destroy old messages and make encrypted video calls and voice memos, and Signal offers simple group messaging and lets you set a time limit on when to destroy messages. WhatsApp may face an uphill battle in continuing to appeal to those seeking heightened access to private communication channels, as Facebook links its other products to the application. ",FB
25,Salvador Rodriguez,"Facebook 'shoegate': Culture clash between sales, engineering, in NY",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/facebook-shoegate-culture-clash-between-sales-engineering-in-ny.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"There are two wings to the Facebook empire: sales and engineering. Engineering is the domain of CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Sales is COO Sheryl Sandberg's. Engineers like to work comfortably and quietly. Sales is loud. Engineering is young and very male. Sales skews older and more diverse. Most engineers can go their entire Facebook careers without ever meeting a salesperson, while only the best sales employees take the time to build relationships with engineers (who can come in handy whenever a client runs into a technical problem). And in most of Facebook's offices, engineers and salespeople rarely interact. At the headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for example, the two work in completely separate buildings. But there are times when the two cultures clash. These clashes are rare, but highlight the tension Facebook faces every day: It must build products that users love and want to use, while simultaneously providing enough value to advertisers to keep the lights on.  One such clash came in 2015 at Facebook's New York offices, one of the most densely populated in the company. Although sales and engineering were kept on separate floors in New York, the two departments shared a common cafeteria. Facebook's New York sales employees often brought big clients into the office for visits, taking them to lunch while on their visits. In that same space, engineers flexed their predilection for comfort. ""Engineers were going to cafeteria without their shoes on, and a sales person wrote, 'Hey, we have clients. Please keep in mind this is a professional environment,'"" a former Facebook sales employee told CNBC. ""Everyone just treated it like a living room,"" said one former contractor. ""That's pretty much what they encouraged … you wouldn't bat an eye if someone was walking around in slippers or socks."" ""It was bizarre,"" said another former contractor. The former sales employee recalled seeing engineers walk barefoot into the bathroom and then barefoot into the cafeteria. The salesperson's post caused ""a flare up"" on the company's internal social network and in the New York office, according to five former employees and contractors who remember the incident, now known as ""shoegate."" Sales and engineering employees left hundreds of comments defending both sides of the shoeless debate, and debating which side of the company was more important. The crux of the debate came down to: engineers build the product, but the salespeople keep the lights on. Despite the battle of words, none of the former employees recall the company implementing any changes to the policy regarding shoes. In 2016, Facebook leased space at another location in New York, giving the two divisions more breathing room to coexist, but at that moment in time, it was ""a clash of cultures,"" a former employee said. Facebook declined to comment. WATCH: A first look inside Facebook's epic headquarters expansion that includes a redwood forest and a botanical garden ",FB
26,David Pinsen,In Case Facebook Is Really 'Fakebook' - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235611-case-facebook-really-fakebook?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryFacebook is up more than 17% over the last month, but PlainSite came out with an extremely negative report on it on Thursday.In that report, PlainSite raised the prospect that half or more of Facebook's accounts might be fake, and the company might head the way of AOL and Prodigy.In the event PlainSite's predictions weigh on the stock over the next several months, I present two ways bullish shareholders can limit their risk. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg (photo via StoryPick). Could Facebook Be Half Fakebook?Could Facebook (FB) be half fake? That was what was alleged in a report by PlainSite Thursday, which was picked up by Seeking Alpha and other sites. PlainSite argued that the situation at Facebook is worse than was commonly understood:Yet as bad as things have been of late for Facebook, with endless privacy breaches and Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election hanging over Menlo Park like a spectre, we believe that the situation is far worse than investors realize. Facebook has been lying to the public about the scale of its problem with fake accounts, which likely exceed 50% of its network. Its official metrics—many of which it has stopped reporting quarterly—are self-contradictory and even farcical. The company has lost control of its own product.PlainSite detailed some consequences if 50% or more of Facebook's accounts are fake: Its customers purchase advertising on Facebook based on the fact that it can supposedly target advertisements at more than 2 billion real human beings. To the extent that users aren’t real, companies are throwing their money down the drain. Fake accounts click on advertising at random, or ""like"" pages, to throw off anti-fraud algorithms. Fake accounts look real if they do not follow a clear pattern. This kind of activity defrauds advertisers, but rewards Facebook with revenue. Fake accounts often defraud other users on Facebook, through scams, fake news, extortion, and other forms of deception. Often, they can involve governments. PlainSite concluded that,it is increasingly likely that Facebook will go the way of AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy—if legal liability doesn’t bankrupt it first.PlainSite's calls for doom might seem surprising, given Facebook's bounce over the last month.But if you are concerned that PlainSite's bearish view may become predominant over the next several months, below are two ways you can stay long while limiting your risk.Limiting Your Risk In FacebookBefore I get to the hedges, a quick reminder: Hedging is for bulls who want to limit their risk. If you're bearish on Facebook, as PlainSite is now, you shouldn't be long the stock.With that said, for the examples below I have assumed you own 500 shares of Facebook and can tolerate a decline of 18% over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Uncapped Upside, Positive CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 500 shares of FB against a &gt;18% decline by late June. The cost for this hedge was $2,200, or 3.02% of position value. This was calculated conservatively though, using the ask price of the puts. In practice, you can often buy and sell hedges at some point between the bid and ask prices.Capped Upside, Negative CostIf you were willing to cap your upside at 16%, this was the optimal collar to protect yourself against the same &gt;18% decline by late June.",FB

There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday. The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall. ""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data. Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts. The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer. Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported. Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said. Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing. Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance. ""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors. ""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me."" The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1. Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third. ""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen."" As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year. Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note. Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising. The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote. They also have a target of $2,250 on the stock. Besides earnings in the coming week, the Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday, but it is not expected to take any rate action. There is also the January employment report on Friday.

28,Shock Exchange,Facebook Q4 Earnings: What You Need To Know - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235680-facebook-q4-earnings-need-know?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryFB reports quarterly earnings next week.MAU growth is slowing.A decline in corporate ad spending could sting by the second half of 2019.Sell FB. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Source: ForbesFacebook (FB) reports quarterly earnings on January 30th. Analysts expect revenue of $16.4 billion and EPS of $2.19. The revenue estimate implies 26% growth Y/Y. Investors should focus on the following key items.Stagnant MAU GrowthFacebook's top line continues to show tremendous growth. I assumed that once its revenue got to a certain level that its growth would plateau. That moment has yet to arrive. Implied 26% revenue growth this quarter follows 33% growth in Q3. Operating income only grew 13% Y/Y as operating income margin fell to 42% from 50% in the year-earlier period. Facebook has increased investments in infrastructure, safety, and security in reaction to regulatory pressures. I find it difficult to believe the company cannot cut into these costs if revenue growth slows.Monthly active users (""MAUs"") are already slowing. More than 2.6 billion people use Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger each month, up from 2.5 billion in Q2 2018. This is a big selling point to advertisers; they can reach over 2 billion people with one advertising campaign. The question is, ""How do you value that pool of users?"" MAUs were 2.3 billion at Q3 2018, up 10% Y/Y and 2% sequentially. As the chart illustrates, MAU growth appeared to have plateaued in Q4 2017. The days of double-digit sequential growth in MAUs are a thing of the past. MAUs could come under further scrutiny after PlainSite alleged a massive number of Facebook's accounts are fake: Facebook shares have fallen in the past hour, giving up the day's gains, coinciding with a negative report from PlainSite alleging a massive number of fake accounts. PlainSite says more than 50% of Facebook's accounts are ""very likely fake."" Moreover, PlainSite says the company is lying about is fake accounts, which would make it liable to its advertising customers for billions of dollars. That said, double-digit sequential growth in MAUs is a thing of the past. Will that alone dampen sentiment for the FB? I doubt it.FB bulls will likely look for any reason to keep buying the stock. The fact that revenue growth is still robust could give bulls hope. Revenue growth that exceeds MAU growth implies average revenue per user (""ARPU"") is increasing. I understand MAUs for Instagram and WhatsApp are growing faster than overall MAUs. Facebook may be increasing ARPU for these revenue streams due to higher levels of engagement.WhatsApp and Instagram may be cannibalizing Facebook sales. They are also likely causing growth in daily active users (""DAUs"") at Snapchat (SNAP) to stagnate. Facebook has scale (over 2 billion MAUs) and it also owns two of social media's fastest growing platforms (Instagram and WhatsApp). It could give the company more pricing power. ARPU could change the narrative and get investors to focus less on declining growth in MAUs.The Economy Is Showing CracksAt the end of the day, Facebook is an advertising company. It sells ads to clients who want to access its massive user base. Regulators, particularly in Europe, are starting to set restraints on the company as it would on any other media outlet. I believe Facebook's revenue and earnings could get hit hard during the next economic downturn, just likely cyclical advertising and media outlets.The Federal Reserve is undoing some of the stimulus it provided over the past decade. Revenue growth at certain industrial giants is now slowing. General Electric's (GE) core Power business is being disrupted by alternative energy sources and Ford (F) is losing money in major markets outside North America. We will learn more about the earnings of 3M (MMM) and Honeywell (HON) next week. They could give us more clarity on whether the global economy is headed lower. If the economy falters (which I believe it will), it will likely tamp down large advertising campaigns by industrial giants and/or consumer brands. This would not be good for Facebook.",FB
29,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer's game plan: Coming in 'too hot' to busiest week of the year,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/cramers-game-plan-coming-in-too-hot-to-busiest-week-of-the-year.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"The stock market might have run too much this week to hold its gains during next week's ""earnings Super Bowl,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rounded out its fifth straight week of gains. ""It's the busiest week of the year and we're coming in hot, maybe too hot, seeing as the market roared today on earnings and hope: hope that the government shutdown really might end, hope that we could get a trade deal with China soon, hope that the Fed won't surprise us when it meets next Wednesday,"" he said. ""Maybe there's too much hope and too much hype."" With that possibility in mind, Cramer, host of ""Mad Money,"" turned to his game plan for the week ahead:  Construction machinery giant Caterpillar will kick of the week with its earnings report, and Cramer had an unexpected take on how investors should play it. ""If you're worried about a global slowdown, especially in China, you'd think CAT would be a perfect short here,"" he said. ""I beg to differ. I believe Caterpillar can make a ton of money at this point in the cycle, much more than people realize."" Unless Caterpillar's management is specifically negative in its comments, ""this stock could fly,"" Cramer said. Still, he worried about the company's propensity for ""shooting itself in the foot."" Verizon: Calling this telecommunications giant ""one of the best-performing stocks around when you take its dividend into consideration,"" Cramer said he expected good things from its Tuesday report. ""This is exactly the kind of slow-and-steady stock that got punished this week,"" he noted. ""I bet Verizon reports a good number, I just don't know if it'll be enough reignite the stock."" Pfizer: The ""Mad Money"" host also worried about Wall Street's distaste in the stock of Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a stock down nearly 7 percent year to date. ""It will stay unloved unless management does something drastic to unlock value,"" he said. 3M: Also at risk of not impressing the Street is manufacturer 3M, the maker of Scotch tape. Cramer hoped to hear some good news from the company, but predicted more pain if it misses estimates. Allergan: Allergan also joins the chorus of companies reporting earnings Tuesday, and Cramer expected good results from the Botox maker and its CEO, Brent Saunders. Apple: Apple rounds out Tuesday's key earnings reports, but investors are still reeling from the iPhone maker's pre-announcement that first-quarter revenues would be softer than expected.   ""I believe the weakness has continued, so it could impact both hardware sales and, maybe more importantly, the service revenue stream,"" Cramer warned. ""That's one reason I keep pushing Apple to make some health-care acquisitions, like Epic Systems or Cerner, because doing something dramatic to bolster the service business could give this stock its mojo back."" But, he admitted, ""I'm concerned because the stock screamed higher [Friday]."" Boeing: Cramer went against Wall Street in his take on aircraft manufacturer Boeing, which issues its quarterly results on Wednesday: ""The conventional wisdom says Boeing's hostage to China, but I think it's the other way around."" AT&amp;T: The ""Mad Money"" host will want to hear how AT&amp;T's cash flow has been augmented by its now-closed acquisition of Time Warner. The telecom player will report earnings before the bell. The Fed: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak and field questions Wednesday as part of the central bank's meeting, and Cramer will be parsing every word. ""If Powell focuses on how hot the economy ... and hiring is, I think that's a signal we'll be getting another rate hike next month,"" Cramer said. ""He may also talk about dumping the Fed's long-term bond holdings — that's another negative for stocks and the economy right now. It's a de facto tightening. This guy can be a one-man wrecking crew if we're not careful."" Tesla: ""A boatload of controversy"" will ensue after Wednesday's closing bell, beginning with a report from automaker Tesla, Cramer said. ""My view on Tesla remains the same: if you love, love, love the car, you're free to own the stock, but I can't recommend it because the balance sheet's so ugly. Tesla needs too much money,"" he explained. Facebook: The controversy continues with a quarterly report from Facebook. Cramer figured the stock was more or less ""inured to negativity at this point,"" but offered some advice for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. ""Zuckerberg needs to talk about the return on investment from [his] projects and he needs to tell us if Facebook can make money now that they're no longer merchandising your data,"" he said. Microsoft: Microsoft has ""been on fire of late,"" Cramer said. Still, he lamented that the tech titan was reporting on such a ""crowded"" day. ""We need more time to understand and digest these conference calls, which is why Wednesday's such a nightmare,"" he said. General Electric: Shares of this embattled industrial have been climbing ahead of its Thursday earnings report, but according to GE guru and J.P. Morgan analyst Steve Tusa, there's no real reason behind the moves, Cramer said. ""The company's cash needs are so humongous that its earnings haven't mattered, but ... I bet the aerospace and health-care divisions will be fantastic when the company reports,"" he said. ""Still, GE needs to raise more money, so we want to know how health care looks as a standalone business. If CEO Larry Culp gives us that, there might be a reason that the stock ran and could run some more."" Amazon: Calling the e-commerce play a ""quandary"" ahead of its report, Cramer worried that Amazon, his charitable trust's largest holding, was ""getting too much advance attention from the bulls."" The Amazon zealots are ""starting to squawk about an upside surprise,"" he said. ""That's worrisome. I want all expectations wrenched out of Amazon's stock before it reports. I'd actually love it, at this point, if the president were to bash the company ahead of the quarter. I want all the fluff gone. That said, Amazon's advertising, retail and web services businesses are all remarkable, and it's arguably the most innovative company on earth, so we're sticking with it."" Honeywell: After United Technologies' strong earnings report, Cramer expected similarly strong results from competitor Honeywell. Exxon Mobil and Chevron: The ""remarkable rebound"" in oil prices so far this year has Cramer curious about what these energy giants have to say. ""I'm not a fan of that group, ... but I think both companies will have a positive story to tell because of oil's stability of late,"" he said. The ""Mad Money"" host might have to pull some all-nighters next week to get a handle on all of this information, but he won't let investors down. ""I left out at least two dozen important companies just because we don't have enough time to address all of them,"" he acknowledged. ""You've got the highlights, though. This is the earnings Super Bowl, people, and as next week goes, especially if you include the Fed, so goes the next month and then some."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, J.P. Morgan, Amazon and Honeywell. ",FB
30,CNBC,"UPDATE 2-Zuckerberg to integrate WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger -NYT",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-update-2-zuckerberg-to-integrate-whatsapp-instagram-and-facebook-messenger-nyt.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"-NYT@ (Adds comment from former Facebook engineer and other researchers) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is planning to unify the underlying messaging infrastructure of the WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger services and incorporate end-to-end encryption into these apps, the New York Times reported on Friday. The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messen g e r . h t m l said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. ""There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,"" a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. ""If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,"" Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an ""extreme remedy"" by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. MAJOR TRADEOFFS Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. ""I'm cautiously optimistic it's a good thing,"" said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. ""My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption."" However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. ""It should be an open process, because you can't have it all,"" Stamos said.

The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens ""does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic."" Glass Lewis in its analysis said a ""more thorough discussion is warranted at this time."" They cite the immediate financial and legal risks to the company, as well as the additional threats. Walgreens owns about one-fourth of AmerisourceBergen, which is also embroiled in opioid litigation.",JNJ
1,William Stamm,Buy Johnson & Johnson For Safe Increasing Income With Dividend Increase Coming In April - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235692-buy-johnson-and-johnson-safe-increasing-income-dividend-increase-coming-april?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryJohnson &amp; Johnson is extremely well-diversified in the medical health field with new drugs leading the way; the company has a defensive business that will make money even in difficult times.Johnson &amp; Johnson has increased its dividend for 56 years in a row (a dividend king) and presently has a yield of 2.8%, which is above average.Johnson &amp; Johnson’s total return underperformed the DOW average for my 48-month test period by 2.24%, which is fair, but the company has increasing earnings and dividends looking forward.This article is about Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and why it's a buy for the dividend growth investor. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of medical products and pharmaceuticals. JNJ is a conservative investment that should be in all portfolios, being defensive when the market and economy are weak. The 57th dividend increase in a row is estimated to be in April 2019 from 0.90/Qtr to 0.97/Qtr or a 7% increase. One thing I think that is keeping JNJ down is the lawsuits concerning asbestos in their talcum powder. This is over-done, giving us a chance to buy JNJ at a fair price. Tests have shown that there is not any asbestos in the baby talcum powder, and all cases so far have been overturned on appeal. Johnson &amp; Johnson is 8.1% of The Good Business Portfolio. The company has steady growth and has plenty of cash it uses to buy bolt-on companies, develop new drugs, and increase the dividend each year.When I scanned the five-year chart, Johnson &amp; Johnson has a good chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for three of the five years with a pause in 2015 and 2018 when the market was a bit negative. Data by YChartsFundamentals of Johnson &amp; Johnson will be reviewed on the following topics below: The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines Total Return and Yearly Dividend Last Quarter's Earnings Company Business Takeaways Recent Portfolio Changes I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Good Business Portfolio GuidelinesJohnson &amp; Johnson passes 9 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a fair score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below: Johnson &amp; Johnson does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield, with 56 years of increasing dividends and a 2.8% yield. Johnson &amp; Johnson is, therefore, a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate at 51%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for investment in expanding the business by buying bolt-on companies and increasing the dividend. I have a capitalization guideline where the capitalization must be greater than $10 Billion. JNJ easily passes this guideline. JNJ is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $345 Billion. Johnson &amp; Johnson's 2019 projected cash flow at $21 Billion is good, allowing the company to have the means for company growth and increasing the dividend for the 57th year in a row April 2019. I also require the S&amp;P CFRA CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses and my RMD with a CAGR of 7%. My dividends provide 3.3% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.2% plus an inflation cushion of 1.8%. The one-year forward CAGR of 6.0% does not meet my guideline requirement, but I believe the pharmaceutical group will outperform and raise this CAGR. The good future growth for Johnson &amp; Johnson can continue its uptrend benefiting from the continued growth of pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign countries. My total return guideline is that total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. JNJ slightly fails this guideline since the total return is 35.43%, less than the Dow's total return of 37.67%. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $15,800 today. This makes Johnson &amp; Johnson a fair investment for the total return investor looking back, that has future growth as the economy continues to grow, and more medical products are needed, and the talc headwind dissipates. One of my guidelines is that the S&amp;P rating must be three stars or better. JNJ's S&amp;P CFRA rating is three stars or hold with a target price of $137, passing the guideline. JNJ's price is presently 5% below the one year target. JNJ is under the target price at present and has a low PE of 16, making JNJ a good buy at this entry point. One thing I think that is keeping JNJ down are the lawsuits concerning asbestos in their baby talcum powder. This is over-done giving us a chance to buy JNJ at a fair price. Scientific tests have shown that there is not any asbestos in the baby talcum powder and all cases so far that have completed the appeal process have been overturned. There is still one large case for 22 women that are still in the appeal process. Take advantage of this valuation and buy this high-quality defensive business. One of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is yes. The total return is fair, and an above-average yield makes JNJ a good business to own for income and growth long term.

Attorneys general of 46 U.S. states announced the settlement agreement in statements on Tuesday. They alleged DePuy engaged in unfair and deceptive practices in the promotion of its ASR XL and Pinnacle Ultamet hip implant devices. DePuy in a statement said the settlement involves no admission of liability or misconduct on the part of the companies. ""DePuy Synthes remains committed to meeting the current and future needs of orthopedic surgeons and patients,"" the company said. The states claimed J&amp;J made misleading claims about the longevity of its metal-on-metal hip implants, with patients frequently having to undergo a revision surgery before the company's advertised timeframe of five years. Under Tuesday's settlement agreement, DePuy is required to maintain a post-market surveillance program and update procedures to track complaints over the hip implants, according to a statement by New York Attorney General Letitia James. DePuy in 2010 announced a worldwide voluntary recall of 93,000 of its ASR hip implant systems, saying that 12 percent of them failed within five years. Saying it would pay at least $2.47 billion, the company has since settled thousands of lawsuits by patients who had to have the ASR implant removed. In 2013, DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations. The Pinnacle system continues to be sold with other material combinations. Metal-on-metal hip implants have also come under scrutiny over allegations that the products cause a build-up of metal ions in the blood, causing groin pain, allergic reactions, bone erosion and tissue death. The company faces some 10,400 lawsuits in the United States over its Pinnacle device in connection with those claims. J&amp;J denies consumer claims related to its Pinnacle products, saying the company acted appropriately and responsibly in the development, testing and marketing of the devices.

Click here to find out more »Investment ThesisWith annual spend in the US alone in the range of $25-85B for products and services (depending on how you calculate it), the advanced wound care segment is poised to explode further. Although performance of the big, traditional players in this space may not always outperform the healthcare/medtech sectors overall, there exist many creative, fast-moving, and indirect plays that make this one of the most attractive segments for investment.IntroductionIn addition to the diverse causes of wounds (trauma, surgery, poor circulation, skin conditions, etc.), a plethora of projected global demographic and epidemiological trends contribute to wounds that are difficult to heal, including: Aging populations, cardiovascular disease (heart, arteries, veins), renal (kidney) disease, diabetes and other endocrinology-related disease, oncological (cancer) disease, rheumatological disease, dermatological issues, obesity and malnutrition, immobility and sedentary lifestyles, immune system compromise, chronic pain, medication side effects, and hundreds of other health conditions related to infection, hereditary, environmental, psycho-social, and other factors. The prevalence and projected growth of these conditions drive a large, unmet demand for advanced wound care that make for an attractive investment opportunity. Yet at this time, there are multiple areas where the deployment of capital to this space is greatly under the current and future potential.This article is primarily intended for healthcare, medtech, and related services and technology investors who seek to either explore advanced wound care opportunities, or to refine assumptions and investment theses.What exactly is advanced wound care?The first key to successful wound care investing is to wrap your head around the core concept of ""what is advanced wound care?"" Healthcare executives and investors who are not strictly focused on wound care are certainly reading this article. Many are already exposed to this space (whether they know it or not). Unfortunately, many damaging wound care due diligence and investment choices are related to a fundamental misunderstanding of what even makes up the segment.Following that initial misstep, even highly intelligent, thorough, and experienced business people have a higher chance of running into major problems that could have been avoided. Before anything else, a solid advanced wound care investment foundation depends on correctly grasping these four core concepts on at least a practical level: The phases of wound healing The difference between simple vs. advanced wounds Local vs. systemic problems with healing A working definition of advanced wound care Finally, we’ll apply that foundation by exploring common investment mistakes made by both rookie and experienced advanced wound care investors alike.So here we go…The phases of wound healing and ""simple"" vs. ""advanced"" woundsLet us suppose a healthy person accidentally cuts his finger while cooking. Assuming the wound is not large, the knife was clean and not rusty, and no major surprises (like slicing an artery), the wound is likely to close on its own. If so, can classify the above example as a ""simple wound"" because we neither expected nor experienced any healing complications making healing take longer than expected.On a very basic and practical level, there are four (or five) overlapping phases of wound healing: Hemostasis - a blood clot forms to stop bleeding, prevent further damage/contamination, and sends signals to trigger the next phases of the healing cascade. Inflammation - increased blood flow; removal of debris and neutralization of bacteria that may have entered the wound. Proliferation - (Often categorized as two separate phases, granulation and epithelialization), where the wound and skin fill in; when this is complete, most clinicians (including for clinical trial endpoints) refer to a wound as ""healed,"" even though there is technically one more phase... Remodeling - (Also referred to as maturation), where the underlying cells continue to restructure and strengthen over time (months or years).",JNJ

""You need to be careful about how much you sell,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money"" after the major averages pulled back dramatically, reflecting worries about slowing economic growth in China. ""There are way too many stocks of high-quality companies that are are still way below their 52-week highs, and, after today, are a lot closer to [their] 52-week lows,"" he said. Cramer specifically flagged the stock of Johnson &amp; Johnson, which he suspected under-promised in its lower-than-anticipated sales forecast for 2019. Shares of the pharmaceutical company ended the trading day 1.45 percent lower, roughly $10 above the stock's 52-week low. Still, Cramer understood investors' dilemma. The International Monetary Fund just slashed its global growth forecast for the next two years, and with a stronger U.S. dollar and a ""tight-fisted"" Federal Reserve, domestic and international U.S. companies are having trouble painting a good picture of the near term for investors, he explained. ""How can the CEO of an industrial company tell a good story when the global economy is indeed slowing?"" he said. ""How can executives go out and tell us not to worry when even Johnson &amp; Johnson sounded a little worried?"" Cramer predicted that this kind of action will lead to ""a rush of traders trying to take profits"" under the assumption that the market will retest, or fall back to, its recent lows as the Fed's potential interest rate increases and a U.S.-China trade talk breakdown remain as risk factors. He added that he doubted the ""retest theory"" would play out. ""In this environment, ... you may want to wait before you buy anything other than the stocks of companies that have already reported much better-than-expected quarters now that they're coming back to earth,"" he said. ""We have had a huge run here off the bottom, ... so it's natural that money managers will want to take something off the table."" For the ""Mad Money"" host, the key to investing in this stock market is knowing your portfolio back and forth and being able to think on your feet. ""To me, this is one of those moments where you have to figure out if you can thread the needle. Are you nimble enough to sell now and buy back a few percentage points lower?"" he said. ""If so, go ahead. You have my blessing. But if you don't believe you can swap out and then swap back in a little bit lower, I think it's OK to wait patiently here and then do some buying at lower levels.""

8,Elizabeth Gurdus,"Cramer: If Apple doesn't buy Epic Systems, here's what it could do",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/cramer-if-apple-doesnt-buy-epic-systems-heres-what-it-could-do.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Last week, CNBC's Jim Cramer said that Apple should consider buying electronic health records manager Epic Systems, and the internet exploded. ""Turns out that story was a lot more provocative than I actually anticipated,"" Cramer said Wednesday. ""It's kind of exactly what I was going for, though. The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer."" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care — as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company — Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. ""I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice."" The ""Mad Money"" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that ""Apple's not a Facebook in disguise"" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. ""Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,"" he explained. ""[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch — that's the opportunity."" He added that integrating Epic — another sore point among the Twitterati — would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? ""Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost."" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: ""If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so."" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of ""ideal"" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. ""One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic — yes, if Judy would sell — or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,"" he said. ""There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?""

9,Passive Income Pursuit,Dividend Growth Check Up - 2018 | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235531-dividend-growth-check-2018?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAnalyzing my real-life portfolio's dividend growth for 2018.Despite market volatility, my portfolio's dividends continued higher.Dividend growth rebounded nicely throughout 2018. The turn of the calendar to the new year is a good time to reflect on the previous year to see how things change. I take the time to look back on the year that was to see how my dividend growth portfolio performed. Not from a return perspective, rather from a purely dividend growth perspective. Since my goal is to build up a portfolio of excellent companies that pay me cold, hard cash in the form of dividends, to support our lifestyle it's the dividends that are the most important part of the portfolio, with capital appreciation taking the backseat. The thing is, dividends are much steadier and more predictable than capital appreciation for any given year. Most of the companies I own increased their dividend at some point during 2018; however, the manic/depressive Mr. Market changed his tune multiple times throughout the year.That's why I want to focus on the dividends that my investments pay me each year and how much they grow each year.Forward Dividends by SectorMy forward dividends for the companies owned in my FI Portfolio ended 2018 at $6,250.78. The following chart shows the breakdown of my forward dividends by their primary sector.By sector, the two largest contributors are consumer discretionary and consumer staples at 21% and 18%, respectively. I'd like to get my consumer staples exposure a bit higher; however, I'm in no rush to do so if the valuation doesn't make sense. Energy is the next largest sector and is forecast to provide 13% of my dividends currently. During 2017's check up, I discussed wanting to reduce my weighting there to the 8-10% range, and well, it stayed the exact same as last year. Looking at the rest of the weightings, there isn't anything that really stands out as needing to be addressed other than health care and possibly the industrials. My target for both would be somewhere closer to the 8-10% range. Industrials were previously weighted closer to that until I closed out my position in Emerson Electric (EMR) in December. Utilities could probably also stand to be boosted up to somewhere in the 5-8% range.Dividend ClubsBack in mid-2015, I wrote about the Dividend Clubs, where each club was a different level of forward dividends. In order to join one of the Dividend Clubs, a holding has to meet the minimum amount of forward dividends for that specific club. So, in order to join the $50 club, a holding has to pay $50 or more in dividends.Think of it as one of those big, multi-room night clubs where there's a hip-hop room, an '80s room, a dance/techno room, a country room, etc. Except, instead of being able to go to each room, the $50 Club members can only stay in the $50 Club, whereas the $100 Club members get to experience the $50 Club and the $100 Club, and so on and so on. The $50 Club increased by 3 compared to the end of 2017 and now sits at 38 members. Sixteen of those holdings are currently stuck in the $50 Club until further notice.The $100 Club lost 1 member over the year as I did some cleaning up of the portfolio in late 2018. Eleven of the $100 Club members max out at the $100 level.The $200 Club grew by 1 member with PepsiCo (PEP) joining the ranks, thanks to a monster dividend increase last year.",JNJ

The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens ""does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic.""

20,Elizabeth Gurdus,"Cramer: If Apple doesn't buy Epic Systems, here's what it could do",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/cramer-if-apple-doesnt-buy-epic-systems-heres-what-it-could-do.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Last week, CNBC's Jim Cramer said that Apple should consider buying electronic health records manager Epic Systems, and the internet exploded. ""Turns out that story was a lot more provocative than I actually anticipated,"" Cramer said Wednesday. ""It's kind of exactly what I was going for, though. The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer."" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care — as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company — Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. ""I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice."" The ""Mad Money"" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that ""Apple's not a Facebook in disguise"" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. ""Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,"" he explained. ""[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch — that's the opportunity."" He added that integrating Epic — another sore point among the Twitterati — would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? ""Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost."" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: ""If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so."" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of ""ideal"" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. ""One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic — yes, if Judy would sell — or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,"" he said. ""There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?""

Not particularly adept as an investor, my father never seriously entertained the idea of using any of the scientific knowledge he may have possessed to gain an edge in markets; the way markets behaved may as well have been Greek to him.Most of Seeking Alpha's readers fall into the opposite end of the spectrum. The ability to sort and filter through abstruse concepts in organic chemistry and bio-pharmacology is not a skill set they generally possess. But lock them in a room with a mountain of financial statements, filings, and earnings call transcripts and they can reach a solid conclusion of whether a stock is reasonably valued at its current price.Enter Jerome Verony and his Second-Level Investing Marketplace service. Jerome views his service as a place where he and his community of fellow biotech investors can pool their knowledge - both scientific and investing - and gain a true edge over even professionals in the biotech space. Says Jerome, ""The nice thing when you come together as investors is you can share resources... we have a great group of investors each of which brings something different and important to the conversation.""Jerome's diverse background makes him uniquely qualified to lead this community.

The measure requires Walgreens to prepare a report by June 30 detailing any changes the company has made to its corporate governance since 2012 in response to the opioid crisis. Investors want more specifics, including how Walgreens' board oversees opioid-related programs and whether executive bonuses consider any opioid-related objectives like promoting ethical conduct. Investors for Opioid Accountability, a coalition that includes state treasurers, comptrollers, asset managers, labor funds and faith-based groups, submitted the proposal. It has filed similar ones with nearly a dozen companies, including drug distributors AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health and drug companies Johnson &amp; Johnson and Pfizer. Walgreens' board opposed the proposal, saying it already discloses how it's handling the issue. Preliminary results showed shareholders voted in favor of the measure, though the company said final results will be released in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. CEO Stefano Pessina is Walgreens' largest shareholder, holding about 15 percent of the company's stock, according to FactSet. Drugmakers, distributors and pharmacies have all come under scrutiny for their role in the crisis that has killed scores of Americans. Lax prescribing and monitoring of prescription painkillers is widely seen as fueling opioid addiction. Now these companies face lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments. Two influential proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services, recommended shareholders vote in favor of the proposal. In its analysis, ISS said despite a proliferation of lawsuits, subpoenas and investigations related to the opioid crisis, Walgreens ""does not seem to have taken steps at the board level related specifically to managing risks stemming from the opioid epidemic.""

31,Elizabeth Gurdus,"Cramer: If Apple doesn't buy Epic Systems, here's what it could do",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/cramer-if-apple-doesnt-buy-epic-systems-heres-what-it-could-do.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Last week, CNBC's Jim Cramer said that Apple should consider buying electronic health records manager Epic Systems, and the internet exploded. ""Turns out that story was a lot more provocative than I actually anticipated,"" Cramer said Wednesday. ""It's kind of exactly what I was going for, though. The whole point was to start a discussion, to figure out how Apple's stock can get its mojo back and possibly put its technology to work to revolutionize and innovate the health-care industry on behalf of you, the customer."" The feedback to Cramer's suggestion ranged from supportive:  To downright negative:  But with Apple clearly making moves into health care — as demonstrated by its talks with Medicare, its research collaboration with Johnson &amp; Johnson and CEO Tim Cook's goals for the company — Cramer thought the topic was well worth revisiting. One of the main arguments against an Apple-Epic tie-up was that Apple's not as trustworthy as it seems. Consumers balked at the thought of sharing their information with the tech giant, but Cramer didn't exactly share their worries. ""I get where this is coming from, but I think this criticism is way off-base,"" he said. ""Sooner or later, some gigantic tech company will make itself into a repository for medical records that's compatible with the many different software systems used by doctors and hospitals. [...] Apple seems like the obvious and logical choice."" The ""Mad Money"" host pointed out that most Apple customers already trust the company with their credit card information, photos and other identifying data, adding that ""Apple's not a Facebook in disguise"" and doesn't sell user data. Others wondered why Apple would even want to break into the fragmented electronic health records business. But if it has an enterprise software platform like Epic's (or competitor Cerner's) under its belt, it could reshape the space, Cramer argued. ""Right now, this industry is a mess because the companies involved have no incentive to cooperate, so your hospital's system may not be able to communicate with the system at your doctor's office,"" he explained. ""[It's] wasteful. It's inefficient. There's a huge unmet need for an outside player to come in and create a universal repository for your health-care records, like, say, the iPhone or the Apple Watch — that's the opportunity."" He added that integrating Epic — another sore point among the Twitterati — would be easier for Apple than people expect given its resources, including its $123 billion cash hoard. He estimated that folding Epic in would cost roughly $20 billion. But the most common feedback by far was that Epic Systems' founder, CEO and controlling shareholder, Judy Faulkner, would never sell her company. She has reportedly created a foundation to eventually inherit nearly all of her Epic stock. Cramer's riposte? ""Let's not miss the forest for the trees here. Epic doesn't want to sell? OK, fine. Then Apple should go buy their biggest competitor, Cerner, a publicly traded company worth $17 billion. The point is that they could revolutionize the electronic medical records space and give their own service business a major boost."" But his favorite response came from health-care blogging guru John Lynn, who wrote an entire piece in response to Cramer's call. In it, he wrote: ""If Judy was to sell, Apple is an interesting acquirer. Apple has created more trust in how it handles data than most technology companies and that's something that would be valued by Judy and Epic. Is it enough? Probably not today. I think Judy still trusts herself and Epic to protect their clients' data 1000 times more than she would trust Apple to do so."" Still, for Cramer, that doesn't strike Apple off the list of ""ideal"" partners for these digital health-care record-keepers. At the end of the day, their business doesn't work the way it's supposed to, and Apple's trust with consumers and wide array of resources could fix that, he said. ""One way or another, Apple is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the electronic health records business. They could make an acquisition like Epic — yes, if Judy would sell — or Cerner, they could build out their own system, they could focus purely on the iPhone as a repository of data,"" he said. ""There are a lot of ways to approach this, and I think any of them would be a win for both patients and for Apple's shareholders, and it's a huge cudgel against those who claim that Apple no longer innovates. That's hogwash. If coming up with a brand new device that can save millions of lives isn't innovation, what the heck is?""

The so-called vice stocks were in a tailspin to start the week. Casino names such as Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands tumbled, digging deeper into the red in the past year, while tobacco stock Altria slumped on a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. The technical setup for one of those names looks ""constructive,"" says Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson. Wynn Resorts ""is putting in a double bottom low, so from my perspective here at $111, this is a stock that should be bought. It's reversed the downtrend off the highs,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday.  A double bottom is formed when a stock hits two equal lows made in quick succession. It is a typically bullish signal for a rebound. ""It looks like you get about 30 percent upside from here back to the 200-day moving average around $140 and change, so from my perspective I'd be a buyer of Wynn down at these levels,"" Johnson said. Altria does not look as positive to Johnson, but he says the technical picture suggests a bottom could be forming. ""I see the next area of support coming in around $41, so you get a little less than 10 percent downside here in this stock and nice dividend support,"" said Johnson. ""It's not something I'm going to step up here and buy, but I also don't see a lot of downside risk to the stock either at these levels.""  Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager at S&amp;P Global, said on ""Trading Nation"" she would steer clear of Altria, although she sees high growth in other less-established vice segments. ""We see this really as a change in investor preference of what is sin,"" Gibbs said. ""When you really look down into the smaller caps — your cannabis companies, your smaller alcoholic beverages — that's where we're seeing the growth and some of these bigger companies, they still have some pretty big headwinds."" Large-cap sin stocks have had a mixed start to the year. While Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands, and Philip Morris have rallied by at least 9 percent, Altria has crumbled 9 percent and British American Tobacco is just 2 percent higher. ",MO
1,Thomas Franck,"Top weed analyst on Wall Street raises sales forecast, names top picks",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/top-weed-analyst-on-wall-street-raises-sales-forecast-names-top-picks.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Wall Street's top cannabis analyst believes U.S. sales of marijuana will rise more than she previously projected to $80 billion by 2030 and told clients to expect major Canadian growers Canopy Growth and Tilray to outperform in 2019. ""We expect continued growth in newly established U.S. states, and more robust growth in Canada as more supply comes online and new form factors hit the market,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Tuesday. ""Given our outlook for continued strong growth in North American cannabis in 2019, we remain constructive on all three of our publicly traded cannabis stocks,"" including Canopy, Tilray and KushCo, an American company that sells packaging for the cannabis industry. Azer is a widely followed analyst of the industry and one of the few from a major firm which covers the industry. Her previous forecast for U.S. cannabis sales by 2030 was $75 billion. After months of political haggling and legal debate, Canada became the first Group of Seven country to OK recreational use of pot on Oct. 17. But despite the excitement surrounding national legalization, Azer said that the adult-use market got off to a rocky start thanks to a rushed retail framework (e.g., no stores in Ontario) and insufficient supply available. Still, as Canadian legislatures gradually legalize new forms of cannabis consumption, planned production expansion should be enough to ease those early concerns. ""With the market set to expand to include novel form factors, and with expanded retail access, we remain encouraged at the market's potential for growth in 2019, where we expect adult use sales (at retail) to total C$3.1 billion (including taxes),"" Azer said. Specifically, Tilray and Canopy Growth should finally start to see the positive effect the adult use market will have on sales. Reported revenue at both companies may have disappointed some investors when Canopy and Tilray posted quarterly results last fall, though the true impact of the legalization was not reflected in those results. Though shares of both Tilray and Canopy are up in 2019, the stocks are off by more than 40 percent over the last three months. Azer expects a ""material increase"" in revenue at Canopy throughout 2019 as supply challenges are addressed. The analysts sees sales jumping from C$239 million in fiscal 2019 to C$778 million in fiscal 2020, a 225 percent rally. ""We remain confident in Canopy's ability to generate such vibrant sequential growth based on the company's seemingly leading share in the market,"" Azer wrote. Based on her e-commerce analysis, the Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company has a leading 18 percent share of all available units in the market. Things are looking up for Tilray, too, including the company's recently expanded relationship with Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis). CEO Brendan Kennedy said in a December statement that the ""agreement represents a major milestone in the movement to provide access to safe, GMP-certified medical cannabis to patients in need across the world."" The company plans to work with Sandoz to supply nonsmokable and noncombustible medical cannabis products where it is legally allowed. Tilray has also said it would partner with global beer giant ABU in Canada, pushing Cowen's revenue estimate to C$120 million in calendar 2019. ""We continue to view the international medical market as one of the primary investment highlights for Tilray, which currently operates in 12 countries,"" Azer wrote. Its ""expanded partnership with Sandoz can help expand reach with pharmacists, physicians and distributors in Tilray's markets, while capturing early share in new medical cannabis markets as they come online.""  While cannabis in the United States remains federally illegal, the U.S. market opportunity is quite sizable, according to Azer, with the current illicit market valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion and expected to flourish over the next decade. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents now support legalizing marijuana, according to the latest Gallup poll. That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. Cannabis represents a ""opportunity"" for big tobacco as more and more U.S. states join those that have already OK'd the adult recreational use of cannabis. Cowen looks to North Dakota, Louisiana and West Virginia to come online and highlights Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania as additional key states to watch. ""After passage of the Farm Bill, CBD will clearly be one of the most topical areas within cannabis over the coming year,"" Azer wrote. ""We expect the category could generate $1.6 billion in revenues over the next year or two, depending on the timing of FDA commentary and the pace of retail acceptance."" The $867 billion farm bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, includes a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had introduced. The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government's list of controlled substances, making it a lawful agricultural commodity. In response to the passage of the farm bill, Canopy CEO Bruce Linton told CNBC that it represents a key ""first step"" toward the company's expansion into the U.S. market. The Food and Drug Administration later said that it is looking for ""pathways"" to legalize the sale of CBD oil and other cannabis-based compounds in food and beverages in a move that could remove one of the last remaining legal hurdles for companies hoping to sell such products across state lines.

2,Angelica LaVito,Juul combats criticism with ad campaign of smokers switching to e-cigs,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/juul-highlights-smokers-switching-to-e-cigarettes-in-ad-campaign.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Juul, the e-cigarette company that has become ubiquitous among teens, is launching its first television ad campaign targeting adult smokers as it faces criticism that its fruity flavors are designed for underaged users. The San Francisco-based e-cigarette company plans to launch over the summer its new TV campaign, featuring testimonials from adults who have used Juul to stop smoking cigarettes, executives said. The ads are likely to draw some controversy. Tobacco companies have long been restricted from most TV or print advertising, with marketing regulations stretching back to the 1970s. Federal and state regulators haven't yet applied the same standards to e-cigarettes, which are a relatively new product. Juul will initially spend almost $10 million for TV slots airing on national cable channels after 10 p.m. local time. The ads, a series of three different commercials, are aimed at adults 35 years and older, executives said. The 60-second spots feature three former smokers between the ages of 37 and 54 who talk about their experience with cigarettes, including how smoking strained relationships or isolated them from families and friends, and how Juul helped them quit smoking. The campaign marks the start of a year Juul will need to spend proving to regulators its product is ending up where its supposed to — in the hands of adult smokers, not teenagers. And fresh with nearly $13 billion in cash from Marlboro-maker Altria, Juul has money to spend to try to change minds that it's not the second coming of Big Tobacco. ""It's clear that we're focused on the mission of the company to convert people off combustible cigarettes,"" said Ann Hoey, Juul's vice president of marketing. ""This is campaign that is a sort of an honest, straight down the middle of the fairway, very clear communication about what we're trying to do as a company."" Juul says its target audience is adults who want to stop smoking cigarettes, but its product has become wildly popular among teens and young adults. Critics have pointed to Juul's first ad campaign, which featured bright colors and youthful looking models, as evidence the company was intentionally marketing to young people. Juul has said it regrets the ads but denies it intentionally targeted teenagers. The company started overhauling its social media accounts last year to highlight testimonials from adults who had switched. It shut down its accounts in the fall facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration to fix the ""epidemic"" of youth e-cigarette use or else have products pulled from the market. Juul has already captured about 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data. However, it's unclear what percent of Juul's sales comes from former adult smokers and what percent comes teens, though critics would say too much comes from the latter group. In running advertisements highlighting stories of adults who have used Juul to stop smoking, it suggests the company sees an opportunity to reach more adult smokers. Over the past year, Juul captured 68 percent of the total $3.25 billion e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data ended Dec. 29 compiled by Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog. However, it represented just 3 percent of the $72.81 billion in overall tobacco sales, which includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars, according to Nielsen. Altria, maker of best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro, announced Dec. 20 that it bought a 35 percent stake in Juul for nearly $13 billion in cash. As part of the deal, Altria will give Juul some of its prime shelf space and add information about Juul to cigarette packs.",MO

Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&amp;T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&amp;T last year, from 2009 until 2018. The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision. Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said. ""He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,"" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr. She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend. A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter. Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys. According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate. As of December 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well. Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria and drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan. Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.",MO
5,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",MO

The uptick in vape usage has undercut and even eclipsed progress in reducing cigarette smoking, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says. Federal data showed teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed last year, prompting the surgeon general to declare it an ""epidemic"" and Gottlieb demanding manufacturers to fix it. Juul, the market leader, suspended sales of its fruity flavors in stores ahead of the FDA effectively pulling these products from convenience stores and limiting them to age-restricted stores like vape shops. Despite these efforts, anecdotal reports suggest some teenagers find themselves hooked on nicotine and unable to stop using e-cigarettes. Doctors treating kids don't have much information on how to properly treat them since the cessation products available today, like nicotine patches and gums, are meant only for adults. The agency put out the call for insight months ago and is holding a rescheduled public hearing on Friday at its Silver Spring, Maryland headquarters. ""For these addicted young people, the reasons that they tried e-cigarettes may not matter anymore,"" Gottlieb said in prepared remarks. ""These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit."" E-cigarettes are billed as a way to help smokers get their nicotine fix without all the toxins that come with smoking cigarettes. However, the surge in young people using e-cigarettes has enraged parents, teachers and now even regulators. Gottlieb believes in e-cigarettes as a way to help adult smokers. But on Friday, he said the industry will face an ""existential threat"" if the number of teens using e-cigarettes does not decrease in this year's survey data. If the trends don't improve, he said, the conversation will shift from where fruity flavors can be sold to whether e-cigarettes can stay on the market. Gottlieb again dangled the threat of reversing a decision that allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications. ""It will be 'game over' for these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process,"" Gottlieb said. ""I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products."" Gottlieb met with executives from five major manufacturers in the fall and plans to send follow-up meeting requests to the leaders of Altria and Juul. In December, Marlboro-maker Altria invested nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul. Two months earlier, Altria said it would voluntarily pull its flavors and pod-based products, saying these features, which Juul popularized, drove the surge in young people using e-cigarettes. ""I have real questions about whether there's consistency,"" Gottlieb told CNBC in an interview last week. Juul in a statement said it's moving ""full steam ahead"" on implementing the action plan it announced in November to prevent minors from using its products.  ""We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations in the effort to combat underage use,"" a spokesman said in a statement.  In the meantime, the FDA wants to find ways to stop teens from using e-cigarettes. Treatments for nicotine addiction on the market today are intended for adults, not minors. Pfizer's Chantix, a prescription drug to help adult smokers quit, failed a clinical trial last year studying whether it worked for teen smokers. Researchers, public health groups and vaping associations are slated to make presentations at Friday's hearing, though one group is noticeably absent from the agenda: drugmakers. Everyone who requested to give a formal presentation or share comments during the open session made it onto the agenda, the FDA said, meaning drug companies did not ask to participate.

7,Trapping Value,"Big Write-Off Coming From Altria As Juul Dreams Go Up In Smoke - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235302-big-write-coming-altria-juul-dreams-go-smoke,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria's $12.8 billion investment in Juul came at a very high multiple.The timing was fantastic for Juul but horrible for Altria.The stock is reflecting a big write-off.We explain why that is most likely and what the impact will be.When we last spoke about Altria (MO), we concludedMO's acquisition was extremely ill-timed. It likely did face pressures of acting, in case some other tobacco company moved first. But by doing so, it created the typical first mover disadvantage at likely the worst possible time. The value destruction is obvious to us. That said, MO is now at a reasonable valuation where the risks of declining sales and even the silly acquisition are priced in. We were negative on the stock earlier and now think that it is much closer to fair value.Source: Altria: I Pity The Fool Who Paid $36 Billion For JUULSince then, the stock has continued to tumble with Morgan Stanley's (MS) latest note striking more panic in the heart of bulls. The recent FDA speech made even the most ardent bulls take notice that the FDA is now very close to intervening in the market. The key takeaways from that speech were, FDA is concerned by an alarming rise in use of e-cigarettes, particularly JUUL among teenagers. From 2017 to 2018, there was a 78% increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48% increase among middle school students. The total number of middle and high school students currently using e-cigarettes rose to 3.6 million — that’s 1.5 million more students using these products than the previous year. FDA has already taken steps to address this and basically will not stop until this trend is reversed. If that means a complete ban of e-cigarettes, they are ready to go there. While investors may downplay that a complete ban will not happen, absolutely any kind of containment of JUUL growth means Altria will be taking an epic write-down.When you pay nosebleed valuations, things better work out wellWe had recently made the comment on NVDIA (NVDA) that things never work out for investors when they purchase a large cap stock at 15X sales. NVDA is at about half that price currently.Altria's purchase price valued JUUL at 36X sales. The total enterprise value of JUUL would make it a large cap, making disappointment guaranteed for Altria. But in Altria's case the write-down will come when the auditors give their opinion at the next annual report. The reasons are quite obvious here. Altria has acquired the JUUL stake just when JUUL was growing at close to 800%. At that point, JUUL’s dollar sales had skyrocketed 783 percent in the 52 weeks ended June 16, reaching $942.6 million, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. The e-cigarette category as a whole grew 97 percent to $1.96 billion in the same period. JUUL now represents more than 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the Nielsen numbers. Essentially, JUUL sales grew from $106.79 million to $942.6 million.In other words, JUUL accounted for 85% of the total growth in e-cigarettes. It is obvious why the FDA is specifically targeting JUUL. JUUL is not part of the problem, it is the problem. But more from the point of Altria's investment, we can extrapolate a few numbers to see how this will play out. To do that we will have to make some assumptions about JUUL's profitability. Considering JUUL itself is private, we will use Altria's numbers to help out.Altria itself reports rather strong gross margins and operating margins. Source: Altria 2017 annual report2017 was the best year for Altria with a rather hefty 37% operating margin. Assuming JUUL can reach the same economies of scale and is not threatened by competition, we can assume similar operating margins for it. Taking a step forward, a 30% net after tax margin is not big stretch either. These assumptions are optimistic as even if e-cigarettes are not banned JUUL will have more competition than the existing companies in the dying tobacco industry face today.All industries mature at some point and some even go into terminal decline. If we assume that at the steady state point JUUL would be worth about 15X earnings, we can extrapolate the kind of sales it needs to get there. Source: Author's estimates",MO
8,Aristofanis Papadatos,"Altria Is Offering A 7.1% Dividend Yield For The First Time In Nearly A Decade - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235254-altria-offering-7_1-percent-dividend-yield-first-time-nearly-decade?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months and is now trading at a 4-year low.The stock is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade.The article discusses whether the stock has become a bargain.Since Altria (NYSE:MO) peaked, in the summer of 2017, it has shed 42%. Even more surprisingly, the stock has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months. This is a very unusual move for this low-beta, slow-moving stock, which is well-known for its defensive characteristics even during bear markets. Due to this poor stock price performance, the tobacco giant is now trading at a 4-year low and is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade. The big question is whether the stock has become a great bargain.The headwinds1. Rising interest ratesMost investors have focused on the challenges facing the business of Altria in order to understand the reasons behind the downtrend of its stock. Nevertheless, they should realize that the environment of rising interest rates, which has nothing to do with the tobacco industry, is a strong headwind for the stock. As most of the shareholders of Altria are holding the stock for its generous and growing dividend, the stock is adversely affected by rising rates, which enable investors to find decent yields elsewhere and thus exert pressure on the valuation of the stock. It is thus only natural that the stock peaked in the summer of 2017, when interest rates were still near record-low levels.On the other hand, the Fed has raised interest rates too aggressively. Notably, its latest hike caused panic in the investing community over a potential recession within the next two years and thus triggered a market sell-off. Since then, Fed officials have been trying to alleviate the market with dovish comments. The Fed is thus likely to slow its pace of interest rate hikes from now on. Moreover, if a recession shows up, interest rates will decrease. Overall, this headwind is not likely to exert additional pressure on the stock for the foreseeable future.2. Acquisition of a stake in JUULWhile rising interest rates have weighed on Altria, another important factor behind its recent plunge is its acquisition of a stake in JUUL (JUUL), the e-vapor leader. Last month, Altria acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 B, thus valuing the company at $38 B. This amount is almost 2.5 times the $16 B valuation JUUL achieved in an investment round six months earlier and is also approximately 38 times the annual revenues of the e-vapor leader.It thus became evident that Altria was willing to purchase a significant stake in its competitor without paying any attention to the valuation. Consequently, the market perceived the deal as a desperate move of Altria to contain its losses from the transition of smokers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. The market also viewed the deal price as an admission of defeat of Altria. After the announcement of the deal, Citi downgraded Altria from ""neutral"" to ""sell"" and cut its price target from $67 to $45 due to the shareholder value destruction that resulted from the sky-high price of the deal.However, it is important to note that Altria essentially hedged its portfolio against the transition of consumers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. In other words, the tobacco giant essentially bought insurance for its business. Thanks to this insurance, it has drastically reduced its exposure to the headwinds facing its traditional products. In addition, as JUUL seems to have ample room to grow for many more years, the 35% stake in the company may begin to generate a significant income stream for Altria at some point in the future.Some investors are also concerned over the high amount of debt that will result from this deal. However, Altria has always spent minimal amounts on capital expenses. To be sure, its capital expenses have been less than 5% of its operating cash flows every single year in the last decade. As a result, the company enjoys excessive free cash flows, which can be used for shareholder distributions and debt reduction.",MO
9,AllStarTrader,"Altria: The Shares Now Are Pricing In The Risk - Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235267-altria-shares-now-pricing-risk?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria shares sold off quite hard due to an analyst downgrade and news of FDA scrutiny on the e-cigarette market.While I believe the company does face significant pressure in its core business, at this point, the risk may be priced in.Management has made questionable moves, but for investors willing to take risk and collect a dividend, now may be the time to start a position. SourceI have been openly taking the opposing view on Seeking Alpha as many investors believe Altria (MO) can do no wrong. In December, I wrote an article stating that Altria was cheap and offered a nice yield. (See: Altria Is Cheap With A Juicy Yield). Shortly thereafter, I sold my shares luckily before they dropped. I believed the deals they made were quite expensive and offered little immediate ROI. While the deal would have been good for the company at a lower price or better terms, this just doesn't seem attractive for shareholders at this price. In fact, I was looking forward to the deals Altria was going to make in both the marijuana space and the e-cigarette space. That being said, I believe even with a negative, forward-looking story, there becomes a point where the shares price in the risk and are worth what I would call a speculative buy. We shall review the deals again below and why the valuation seems enticing here.Acquisitions At A Cost Source: Seeking AlphaPaying $12.8 billion for a non-controlling stake in a company is certainly concerning. It is more concerning that this seems rather high considering this pegs the company with a value of $38 billion when it was valued at $16 billion only in the middle of this year. What I can judge from this is that the existing owners of JUUL (JUUL) did not value Altria and/or find it necessary to bring it in as a partner. They apparently were only interested in doing so at quite a premium to the last funding valuation. This is intriguing considering the extensive knowledge, distribution, and marketing power Altria has to offer. However, it is apparent that Altria wanted access to JUUL and was willing to pay anything for it. Altria now has faced a credit rating downgrade that leaves it with a BBB rating from S&amp;P. Moody's also cut its rating with a negative outlook alongside. This is due to the $15 billion being spent on deals in the last two months.Now, I do believe Altria is doing its best to be with the times and increase its reduced-risk portfolio as it has seen significant volume declines in its core business. However, it needs to do so in a manner that does not come across as desperate. How desperate is the management team that it was willing to pay 19x sales for a stake in a vaping company? Yes, the company is growing rather rapidly, but as the law of large numbers works, the sales growth will slow down. I am sure management has identified what it considers a market opportunity, but it is impossible to estimate what percentage of smokers will transition from combustible products to a vaporizing product. It is also notable that this transition will only cause share loss from Marlboro products. As Marlboro has a market-leading share, it stands to lose the most in the smokable category. According to Forbes, Marlboro had a 43.3% market share in 2017. Furthermore, the company may be promoting what could be an easier way for cigarette users to find an outlet to quit. A transition to a vaping product may allow for an easier out or quitting process of nicotine down the road as it has been proven to do. As noted in this article, which focuses on a study shows, vaping may lead to an easier route to quitting.While I appreciate the management team at Altria looking to participate in the future, I worry at what price, as stated above. Looking into the details of the deal, the company...""...will be subject to a standstill agreement under which it may not acquire additional JUUL shares above its 35% interest. Altria agrees not to sell or transfer any JUUL common shares for six years from closing."" - SourceThis agreement is of particular concern and seemed to be missed by many. Essentially, the company cannot gain the right to maintain a majority share for six years. While this may sound okay, it could come at an even costlier expense to shareholders, as the company would be worth more should sales continue to grow from today's pace. Even a simple double in valuation in the next six years, which seems practical considering the double in the last six months that Altria was willing to pay, would lead to a $76 billion valuation. And while this would obviously make Altria's existing stake very valuable, we must be clear in understanding that to acquire a controlling interest or even 16% of the company, it could cost Altria another $12+ billion. And, presumably, there would not be many in the market for a stake in JUUL at a valuation larger than even the one paid by Altria today.",MO

The so-called vice stocks were in a tailspin to start the week. Casino names such as Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands tumbled, digging deeper into the red in the past year, while tobacco stock Altria slumped on a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. The technical setup for one of those names looks ""constructive,"" says Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson. Wynn Resorts ""is putting in a double bottom low, so from my perspective here at $111, this is a stock that should be bought. It's reversed the downtrend off the highs,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday.  A double bottom is formed when a stock hits two equal lows made in quick succession. It is a typically bullish signal for a rebound. ""It looks like you get about 30 percent upside from here back to the 200-day moving average around $140 and change, so from my perspective I'd be a buyer of Wynn down at these levels,"" Johnson said. Altria does not look as positive to Johnson, but he says the technical picture suggests a bottom could be forming. ""I see the next area of support coming in around $41, so you get a little less than 10 percent downside here in this stock and nice dividend support,"" said Johnson. ""It's not something I'm going to step up here and buy, but I also don't see a lot of downside risk to the stock either at these levels.""  Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager at S&amp;P Global, said on ""Trading Nation"" she would steer clear of Altria, although she sees high growth in other less-established vice segments. ""We see this really as a change in investor preference of what is sin,"" Gibbs said. ""When you really look down into the smaller caps — your cannabis companies, your smaller alcoholic beverages — that's where we're seeing the growth and some of these bigger companies, they still have some pretty big headwinds."" Large-cap sin stocks have had a mixed start to the year. While Wynn Resorts, Las Vegas Sands, and Philip Morris have rallied by at least 9 percent, Altria has crumbled 9 percent and British American Tobacco is just 2 percent higher. ",MO
15,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",MO
16,Thomas Franck,"Top weed analyst on Wall Street raises sales forecast, names top picks",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/top-weed-analyst-on-wall-street-raises-sales-forecast-names-top-picks.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Wall Street's top cannabis analyst believes U.S. sales of marijuana will rise more than she previously projected to $80 billion by 2030 and told clients to expect major Canadian growers Canopy Growth and Tilray to outperform in 2019. ""We expect continued growth in newly established U.S. states, and more robust growth in Canada as more supply comes online and new form factors hit the market,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Tuesday. ""Given our outlook for continued strong growth in North American cannabis in 2019, we remain constructive on all three of our publicly traded cannabis stocks,"" including Canopy, Tilray and KushCo, an American company that sells packaging for the cannabis industry. Azer is a widely followed analyst of the industry and one of the few from a major firm which covers the industry. Her previous forecast for U.S. cannabis sales by 2030 was $75 billion. After months of political haggling and legal debate, Canada became the first Group of Seven country to OK recreational use of pot on Oct. 17. But despite the excitement surrounding national legalization, Azer said that the adult-use market got off to a rocky start thanks to a rushed retail framework (e.g., no stores in Ontario) and insufficient supply available. Still, as Canadian legislatures gradually legalize new forms of cannabis consumption, planned production expansion should be enough to ease those early concerns. ""With the market set to expand to include novel form factors, and with expanded retail access, we remain encouraged at the market's potential for growth in 2019, where we expect adult use sales (at retail) to total C$3.1 billion (including taxes),"" Azer said. Specifically, Tilray and Canopy Growth should finally start to see the positive effect the adult use market will have on sales. Reported revenue at both companies may have disappointed some investors when Canopy and Tilray posted quarterly results last fall, though the true impact of the legalization was not reflected in those results. Though shares of both Tilray and Canopy are up in 2019, the stocks are off by more than 40 percent over the last three months. Azer expects a ""material increase"" in revenue at Canopy throughout 2019 as supply challenges are addressed. The analysts sees sales jumping from C$239 million in fiscal 2019 to C$778 million in fiscal 2020, a 225 percent rally. ""We remain confident in Canopy's ability to generate such vibrant sequential growth based on the company's seemingly leading share in the market,"" Azer wrote. Based on her e-commerce analysis, the Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company has a leading 18 percent share of all available units in the market. Things are looking up for Tilray, too, including the company's recently expanded relationship with Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis). CEO Brendan Kennedy said in a December statement that the ""agreement represents a major milestone in the movement to provide access to safe, GMP-certified medical cannabis to patients in need across the world."" The company plans to work with Sandoz to supply nonsmokable and noncombustible medical cannabis products where it is legally allowed. Tilray has also said it would partner with global beer giant ABU in Canada, pushing Cowen's revenue estimate to C$120 million in calendar 2019. ""We continue to view the international medical market as one of the primary investment highlights for Tilray, which currently operates in 12 countries,"" Azer wrote. Its ""expanded partnership with Sandoz can help expand reach with pharmacists, physicians and distributors in Tilray's markets, while capturing early share in new medical cannabis markets as they come online.""  While cannabis in the United States remains federally illegal, the U.S. market opportunity is quite sizable, according to Azer, with the current illicit market valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion and expected to flourish over the next decade. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents now support legalizing marijuana, according to the latest Gallup poll. That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. Cannabis represents a ""opportunity"" for big tobacco as more and more U.S. states join those that have already OK'd the adult recreational use of cannabis. Cowen looks to North Dakota, Louisiana and West Virginia to come online and highlights Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania as additional key states to watch. ""After passage of the Farm Bill, CBD will clearly be one of the most topical areas within cannabis over the coming year,"" Azer wrote. ""We expect the category could generate $1.6 billion in revenues over the next year or two, depending on the timing of FDA commentary and the pace of retail acceptance."" The $867 billion farm bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, includes a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had introduced. The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government's list of controlled substances, making it a lawful agricultural commodity. In response to the passage of the farm bill, Canopy CEO Bruce Linton told CNBC that it represents a key ""first step"" toward the company's expansion into the U.S. market. The Food and Drug Administration later said that it is looking for ""pathways"" to legalize the sale of CBD oil and other cannabis-based compounds in food and beverages in a move that could remove one of the last remaining legal hurdles for companies hoping to sell such products across state lines.

However, Cronos (CRON) has quietly overtaken Tilray as the most expensive stock as both stocks traded in opposite directions during the last few months.Tilray Slowly Deflating We all know Tilray is overvalued. There have been hundreds of articles written on this stock all over the internet. In any case, it does not seem to make sense that few months after it completed its IPO at US$17 per share, the stock could reach as high as US$300 at one point. We have told readers that a fair price would have been US$30 - $40 when the cannabis market was red hot. However, without too much attention, Tilray's stock has actually been slowly deflating. The stock closed around US$70 last week, trading ""just 4x"" above the IPO price and down ~80% from its all-time high. (Source: Bloomberg)In the meantime, Tilray has announced a US$100 million joint research project with AB InBev (BUD) that had little impact on the stock. The weak Q3 reported by the company did not help either, as investors reassess the then-most expensive stock on earth to see how much it's actually worth.

However, the Altria (MO) investment has altered the story as one could do many things with US$1.8 billion of cash. The stock has traded up significantly since the Altria announcement on December 7. In fact, Cronos shares climbed 40% that week and significantly outperformed just about every single other cannabis stock in the world. Cronos is now trading at its all-time high and well above the price Altria that paid at C$16.25. Altria has warrants exercisable at C$19.00 which are actually in the money right now. (Source: Bloomberg)Cronos More Expensive Than TilrayThe result of the divergent share price performances in the last few months is that Cronos has overtaken Tilray as the most expensive cannabis stock now. Based on the last quarter revenue reported by both companies and the market capitalization as of last Friday (Cronos has been adjusted to reflect Altria's investment), Cronos trades at 266x versus Tilray at 155x EV / revenue.",MO
18,Angelica LaVito,Juul combats criticism with ad campaign of smokers switching to e-cigs,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/juul-highlights-smokers-switching-to-e-cigarettes-in-ad-campaign.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Juul, the e-cigarette company that has become ubiquitous among teens, is launching its first television ad campaign targeting adult smokers as it faces criticism that its fruity flavors are designed for underaged users. The San Francisco-based e-cigarette company plans to launch over the summer its new TV campaign, featuring testimonials from adults who have used Juul to stop smoking cigarettes, executives said. The ads are likely to draw some controversy. Tobacco companies have long been restricted from most TV or print advertising, with marketing regulations stretching back to the 1970s. Federal and state regulators haven't yet applied the same standards to e-cigarettes, which are a relatively new product. Juul will initially spend almost $10 million for TV slots airing on national cable channels after 10 p.m. local time. The ads, a series of three different commercials, are aimed at adults 35 years and older, executives said. The 60-second spots feature three former smokers between the ages of 37 and 54 who talk about their experience with cigarettes, including how smoking strained relationships or isolated them from families and friends, and how Juul helped them quit smoking. The campaign marks the start of a year Juul will need to spend proving to regulators its product is ending up where its supposed to — in the hands of adult smokers, not teenagers. And fresh with nearly $13 billion in cash from Marlboro-maker Altria, Juul has money to spend to try to change minds that it's not the second coming of Big Tobacco. ""It's clear that we're focused on the mission of the company to convert people off combustible cigarettes,"" said Ann Hoey, Juul's vice president of marketing. ""This is campaign that is a sort of an honest, straight down the middle of the fairway, very clear communication about what we're trying to do as a company."" Juul says its target audience is adults who want to stop smoking cigarettes, but its product has become wildly popular among teens and young adults. Critics have pointed to Juul's first ad campaign, which featured bright colors and youthful looking models, as evidence the company was intentionally marketing to young people. Juul has said it regrets the ads but denies it intentionally targeted teenagers. The company started overhauling its social media accounts last year to highlight testimonials from adults who had switched. It shut down its accounts in the fall facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration to fix the ""epidemic"" of youth e-cigarette use or else have products pulled from the market. Juul has already captured about 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data. However, it's unclear what percent of Juul's sales comes from former adult smokers and what percent comes teens, though critics would say too much comes from the latter group. In running advertisements highlighting stories of adults who have used Juul to stop smoking, it suggests the company sees an opportunity to reach more adult smokers. Over the past year, Juul captured 68 percent of the total $3.25 billion e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data ended Dec. 29 compiled by Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog. However, it represented just 3 percent of the $72.81 billion in overall tobacco sales, which includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars, according to Nielsen. Altria, maker of best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro, announced Dec. 20 that it bought a 35 percent stake in Juul for nearly $13 billion in cash. As part of the deal, Altria will give Juul some of its prime shelf space and add information about Juul to cigarette packs.",MO

Tiger Global's hedge fund invests some $8 billion in assets and gained 0.9 percent in December. That compares with the fortunes of many hedge funds that lost money in December and saw their gains for the year wiped out. A Tiger Global spokeswoman declined to comment. 2018 was a second straight year of strong returns for Tiger Global after its hedge fund gained 28.2 percent in 2017. The average stocks-oriented hedge fund lost 6.9 percent last year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Tiger Global, founded by Chase Coleman in 2001, has historically invested in technology companies and got a boost from betting that companies would fall, or shorting, in 2018. Performance was also fueled by bets on Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.. The firm also got a boost from its investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc.

20,CNBC,Trump's attorney general nominee to recuse from AT&T-Time Warner appeal,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/11/trumps-attorney-general-nominee-to-recuse-from-att-time-warner-appeal.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"William Barr, nominated by President Donald Trump to become U.S. attorney general, plans to recuse himself from a major antitrust case, according to people who spoke with him on Thursday, as he navigates possible conflicts of interest presented by about $37 million in assets he amassed as a private-sector lawyer. Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&amp;T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&amp;T last year, from 2009 until 2018. The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision. Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said. ""He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,"" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr. She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend. A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter. Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys. According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate. As of December 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well. Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria and drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan. Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.",MO

(NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235254-altria-offering-7_1-percent-dividend-yield-first-time-nearly-decade?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months and is now trading at a 4-year low.The stock is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade.The article discusses whether the stock has become a bargain.Since Altria (NYSE:MO) peaked, in the summer of 2017, it has shed 42%. Even more surprisingly, the stock has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months. This is a very unusual move for this low-beta, slow-moving stock, which is well-known for its defensive characteristics even during bear markets. Due to this poor stock price performance, the tobacco giant is now trading at a 4-year low and is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade. The big question is whether the stock has become a great bargain.The headwinds1. Rising interest ratesMost investors have focused on the challenges facing the business of Altria in order to understand the reasons behind the downtrend of its stock. Nevertheless, they should realize that the environment of rising interest rates, which has nothing to do with the tobacco industry, is a strong headwind for the stock. As most of the shareholders of Altria are holding the stock for its generous and growing dividend, the stock is adversely affected by rising rates, which enable investors to find decent yields elsewhere and thus exert pressure on the valuation of the stock. It is thus only natural that the stock peaked in the summer of 2017, when interest rates were still near record-low levels.On the other hand, the Fed has raised interest rates too aggressively. Notably, its latest hike caused panic in the investing community over a potential recession within the next two years and thus triggered a market sell-off. Since then, Fed officials have been trying to alleviate the market with dovish comments. The Fed is thus likely to slow its pace of interest rate hikes from now on. Moreover, if a recession shows up, interest rates will decrease. Overall, this headwind is not likely to exert additional pressure on the stock for the foreseeable future.2. Acquisition of a stake in JUULWhile rising interest rates have weighed on Altria, another important factor behind its recent plunge is its acquisition of a stake in JUUL (JUUL), the e-vapor leader. Last month, Altria acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 B, thus valuing the company at $38 B. This amount is almost 2.5 times the $16 B valuation JUUL achieved in an investment round six months earlier and is also approximately 38 times the annual revenues of the e-vapor leader.It thus became evident that Altria was willing to purchase a significant stake in its competitor without paying any attention to the valuation. Consequently, the market perceived the deal as a desperate move of Altria to contain its losses from the transition of smokers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. The market also viewed the deal price as an admission of defeat of Altria. After the announcement of the deal, Citi downgraded Altria from ""neutral"" to ""sell"" and cut its price target from $67 to $45 due to the shareholder value destruction that resulted from the sky-high price of the deal.However, it is important to note that Altria essentially hedged its portfolio against the transition of consumers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. In other words, the tobacco giant essentially bought insurance for its business. Thanks to this insurance, it has drastically reduced its exposure to the headwinds facing its traditional products. In addition, as JUUL seems to have ample room to grow for many more years, the 35% stake in the company may begin to generate a significant income stream for Altria at some point in the future.Some investors are also concerned over the high amount of debt that will result from this deal. However, Altria has always spent minimal amounts on capital expenses. To be sure, its capital expenses have been less than 5% of its operating cash flows every single year in the last decade. As a result, the company enjoys excessive free cash flows, which can be used for shareholder distributions and debt reduction.",MO

The uptick in vape usage has undercut and even eclipsed progress in reducing cigarette smoking, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says. Federal data showed teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed last year, prompting the surgeon general to declare it an ""epidemic"" and Gottlieb demanding manufacturers to fix it. Juul, the market leader, suspended sales of its fruity flavors in stores ahead of the FDA effectively pulling these products from convenience stores and limiting them to age-restricted stores like vape shops. Despite these efforts, anecdotal reports suggest some teenagers find themselves hooked on nicotine and unable to stop using e-cigarettes. Doctors treating kids don't have much information on how to properly treat them since the cessation products available today, like nicotine patches and gums, are meant only for adults. The agency put out the call for insight months ago and is holding a rescheduled public hearing on Friday at its Silver Spring, Maryland headquarters. ""For these addicted young people, the reasons that they tried e-cigarettes may not matter anymore,"" Gottlieb said in prepared remarks. ""These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit."" E-cigarettes are billed as a way to help smokers get their nicotine fix without all the toxins that come with smoking cigarettes. However, the surge in young people using e-cigarettes has enraged parents, teachers and now even regulators. Gottlieb believes in e-cigarettes as a way to help adult smokers. But on Friday, he said the industry will face an ""existential threat"" if the number of teens using e-cigarettes does not decrease in this year's survey data. If the trends don't improve, he said, the conversation will shift from where fruity flavors can be sold to whether e-cigarettes can stay on the market. Gottlieb again dangled the threat of reversing a decision that allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications. ""It will be 'game over' for these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process,"" Gottlieb said. ""I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products."" Gottlieb met with executives from five major manufacturers in the fall and plans to send follow-up meeting requests to the leaders of Altria and Juul. In December, Marlboro-maker Altria invested nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul. Two months earlier, Altria said it would voluntarily pull its flavors and pod-based products, saying these features, which Juul popularized, drove the surge in young people using e-cigarettes. ""I have real questions about whether there's consistency,"" Gottlieb told CNBC in an interview last week. Juul in a statement said it's moving ""full steam ahead"" on implementing the action plan it announced in November to prevent minors from using its products.  ""We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations in the effort to combat underage use,"" a spokesman said in a statement.  In the meantime, the FDA wants to find ways to stop teens from using e-cigarettes. Treatments for nicotine addiction on the market today are intended for adults, not minors. Pfizer's Chantix, a prescription drug to help adult smokers quit, failed a clinical trial last year studying whether it worked for teen smokers. Researchers, public health groups and vaping associations are slated to make presentations at Friday's hearing, though one group is noticeably absent from the agenda: drugmakers. Everyone who requested to give a formal presentation or share comments during the open session made it onto the agenda, the FDA said, meaning drug companies did not ask to participate.

(NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235267-altria-shares-now-pricing-risk?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria shares sold off quite hard due to an analyst downgrade and news of FDA scrutiny on the e-cigarette market.While I believe the company does face significant pressure in its core business, at this point, the risk may be priced in.Management has made questionable moves, but for investors willing to take risk and collect a dividend, now may be the time to start a position. SourceI have been openly taking the opposing view on Seeking Alpha as many investors believe Altria (MO) can do no wrong. In December, I wrote an article stating that Altria was cheap and offered a nice yield. (See: Altria Is Cheap With A Juicy Yield). Shortly thereafter, I sold my shares luckily before they dropped. I believed the deals they made were quite expensive and offered little immediate ROI. While the deal would have been good for the company at a lower price or better terms, this just doesn't seem attractive for shareholders at this price. In fact, I was looking forward to the deals Altria was going to make in both the marijuana space and the e-cigarette space. That being said, I believe even with a negative, forward-looking story, there becomes a point where the shares price in the risk and are worth what I would call a speculative buy. We shall review the deals again below and why the valuation seems enticing here.Acquisitions At A Cost Source: Seeking AlphaPaying $12.8 billion for a non-controlling stake in a company is certainly concerning. It is more concerning that this seems rather high considering this pegs the company with a value of $38 billion when it was valued at $16 billion only in the middle of this year. What I can judge from this is that the existing owners of JUUL (JUUL) did not value Altria and/or find it necessary to bring it in as a partner. They apparently were only interested in doing so at quite a premium to the last funding valuation. This is intriguing considering the extensive knowledge, distribution, and marketing power Altria has to offer. However, it is apparent that Altria wanted access to JUUL and was willing to pay anything for it. Altria now has faced a credit rating downgrade that leaves it with a BBB rating from S&amp;P. Moody's also cut its rating with a negative outlook alongside. This is due to the $15 billion being spent on deals in the last two months.Now, I do believe Altria is doing its best to be with the times and increase its reduced-risk portfolio as it has seen significant volume declines in its core business. However, it needs to do so in a manner that does not come across as desperate. How desperate is the management team that it was willing to pay 19x sales for a stake in a vaping company? Yes, the company is growing rather rapidly, but as the law of large numbers works, the sales growth will slow down. I am sure management has identified what it considers a market opportunity, but it is impossible to estimate what percentage of smokers will transition from combustible products to a vaporizing product. It is also notable that this transition will only cause share loss from Marlboro products. As Marlboro has a market-leading share, it stands to lose the most in the smokable category. According to Forbes, Marlboro had a 43.3% market share in 2017. Furthermore, the company may be promoting what could be an easier way for cigarette users to find an outlet to quit. A transition to a vaping product may allow for an easier out or quitting process of nicotine down the road as it has been proven to do. As noted in this article, which focuses on a study shows, vaping may lead to an easier route to quitting.While I appreciate the management team at Altria looking to participate in the future, I worry at what price, as stated above. Looking into the details of the deal, the company...""...will be subject to a standstill agreement under which it may not acquire additional JUUL shares above its 35% interest. Altria agrees not to sell or transfer any JUUL common shares for six years from closing."" - SourceThis agreement is of particular concern and seemed to be missed by many. Essentially, the company cannot gain the right to maintain a majority share for six years. While this may sound okay, it could come at an even costlier expense to shareholders, as the company would be worth more should sales continue to grow from today's pace. Even a simple double in valuation in the next six years, which seems practical considering the double in the last six months that Altria was willing to pay, would lead to a $76 billion valuation. And while this would obviously make Altria's existing stake very valuable, we must be clear in understanding that to acquire a controlling interest or even 16% of the company, it could cost Altria another $12+ billion. And, presumably, there would not be many in the market for a stake in JUUL at a valuation larger than even the one paid by Altria today.",MO

We were negative on the stock earlier and now think that it is much closer to fair value.Source: Altria: I Pity The Fool Who Paid $36 Billion For JUULSince then, the stock has continued to tumble with Morgan Stanley's (MS) latest note striking more panic in the heart of bulls. The recent FDA speech made even the most ardent bulls take notice that the FDA is now very close to intervening in the market. The key takeaways from that speech were, FDA is concerned by an alarming rise in use of e-cigarettes, particularly JUUL among teenagers. From 2017 to 2018, there was a 78% increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48% increase among middle school students. The total number of middle and high school students currently using e-cigarettes rose to 3.6 million — that’s 1.5 million more students using these products than the previous year. FDA has already taken steps to address this and basically will not stop until this trend is reversed. If that means a complete ban of e-cigarettes, they are ready to go there. While investors may downplay that a complete ban will not happen, absolutely any kind of containment of JUUL growth means Altria will be taking an epic write-down.When you pay nosebleed valuations, things better work out wellWe had recently made the comment on NVDIA (NVDA) that things never work out for investors when they purchase a large cap stock at 15X sales. NVDA is at about half that price currently.Altria's purchase price valued JUUL at 36X sales. The total enterprise value of JUUL would make it a large cap, making disappointment guaranteed for Altria. But in Altria's case the write-down will come when the auditors give their opinion at the next annual report. The reasons are quite obvious here. Altria has acquired the JUUL stake just when JUUL was growing at close to 800%. At that point, JUUL’s dollar sales had skyrocketed 783 percent in the 52 weeks ended June 16, reaching $942.6 million, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. The e-cigarette category as a whole grew 97 percent to $1.96 billion in the same period. JUUL now represents more than 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the Nielsen numbers. Essentially, JUUL sales grew from $106.79 million to $942.6 million.In other words, JUUL accounted for 85% of the total growth in e-cigarettes. It is obvious why the FDA is specifically targeting JUUL. JUUL is not part of the problem, it is the problem. But more from the point of Altria's investment, we can extrapolate a few numbers to see how this will play out. To do that we will have to make some assumptions about JUUL's profitability. Considering JUUL itself is private, we will use Altria's numbers to help out.Altria itself reports rather strong gross margins and operating margins. Source: Altria 2017 annual report2017 was the best year for Altria with a rather hefty 37% operating margin. Assuming JUUL can reach the same economies of scale and is not threatened by competition, we can assume similar operating margins for it. Taking a step forward, a 30% net after tax margin is not big stretch either. These assumptions are optimistic as even if e-cigarettes are not banned JUUL will have more competition than the existing companies in the dying tobacco industry face today.All industries mature at some point and some even go into terminal decline. If we assume that at the steady state point JUUL would be worth about 15X earnings, we can extrapolate the kind of sales it needs to get there. Source: Author's estimates",MO

Casino names such as Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands tumbled, digging deeper into the red in the past year, while tobacco stock Altria slumped on a downgrade from Morgan Stanley. The technical setup for one of those names looks ""constructive,"" says Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson. Wynn Resorts ""is putting in a double bottom low, so from my perspective here at $111, this is a stock that should be bought.

It is a typically bullish signal for a rebound. ""It looks like you get about 30 percent upside from here back to the 200-day moving average around $140 and change, so from my perspective I'd be a buyer of Wynn down at these levels,"" Johnson said. Altria does not look as positive to Johnson, but he says the technical picture suggests a bottom could be forming.

""We expect continued growth in newly established U.S. states, and more robust growth in Canada as more supply comes online and new form factors hit the market,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer wrote Tuesday. ""Given our outlook for continued strong growth in North American cannabis in 2019, we remain constructive on all three of our publicly traded cannabis stocks,"" including Canopy, Tilray and KushCo, an American company that sells packaging for the cannabis industry. Azer is a widely followed analyst of the industry and one of the few from a major firm which covers the industry. Her previous forecast for U.S. cannabis sales by 2030 was $75 billion. After months of political haggling and legal debate, Canada became the first Group of Seven country to OK recreational use of pot on Oct. 17. But despite the excitement surrounding national legalization, Azer said that the adult-use market got off to a rocky start thanks to a rushed retail framework (e.g., no stores in Ontario) and insufficient supply available. Still, as Canadian legislatures gradually legalize new forms of cannabis consumption, planned production expansion should be enough to ease those early concerns. ""With the market set to expand to include novel form factors, and with expanded retail access, we remain encouraged at the market's potential for growth in 2019, where we expect adult use sales (at retail) to total C$3.1 billion (including taxes),"" Azer said. Specifically, Tilray and Canopy Growth should finally start to see the positive effect the adult use market will have on sales. Reported revenue at both companies may have disappointed some investors when Canopy and Tilray posted quarterly results last fall, though the true impact of the legalization was not reflected in those results. Though shares of both Tilray and Canopy are up in 2019, the stocks are off by more than 40 percent over the last three months. Azer expects a ""material increase"" in revenue at Canopy throughout 2019 as supply challenges are addressed. The analysts sees sales jumping from C$239 million in fiscal 2019 to C$778 million in fiscal 2020, a 225 percent rally. ""We remain confident in Canopy's ability to generate such vibrant sequential growth based on the company's seemingly leading share in the market,"" Azer wrote. Based on her e-commerce analysis, the Smiths Falls, Ontario-based company has a leading 18 percent share of all available units in the market. Things are looking up for Tilray, too, including the company's recently expanded relationship with Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis). CEO Brendan Kennedy said in a December statement that the ""agreement represents a major milestone in the movement to provide access to safe, GMP-certified medical cannabis to patients in need across the world."" The company plans to work with Sandoz to supply nonsmokable and noncombustible medical cannabis products where it is legally allowed. Tilray has also said it would partner with global beer giant ABU in Canada, pushing Cowen's revenue estimate to C$120 million in calendar 2019. ""We continue to view the international medical market as one of the primary investment highlights for Tilray, which currently operates in 12 countries,"" Azer wrote. Its ""expanded partnership with Sandoz can help expand reach with pharmacists, physicians and distributors in Tilray's markets, while capturing early share in new medical cannabis markets as they come online.""  While cannabis in the United States remains federally illegal, the U.S. market opportunity is quite sizable, according to Azer, with the current illicit market valued at around $40 billion to $50 billion and expected to flourish over the next decade. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents now support legalizing marijuana, according to the latest Gallup poll. That's a record high and was the third consecutive year that support for legalization has increased to record levels. Cannabis represents a ""opportunity"" for big tobacco as more and more U.S. states join those that have already OK'd the adult recreational use of cannabis. Cowen looks to North Dakota, Louisiana and West Virginia to come online and highlights Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania as additional key states to watch. ""After passage of the Farm Bill, CBD will clearly be one of the most topical areas within cannabis over the coming year,"" Azer wrote. ""We expect the category could generate $1.6 billion in revenues over the next year or two, depending on the timing of FDA commentary and the pace of retail acceptance."" The $867 billion farm bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on Dec. 20, includes a provision for industrial hemp legalization that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had introduced. The provision removed industrial hemp from the federal government's list of controlled substances, making it a lawful agricultural commodity. In response to the passage of the farm bill, Canopy CEO Bruce Linton told CNBC that it represents a key ""first step"" toward the company's expansion into the U.S. market. The Food and Drug Administration later said that it is looking for ""pathways"" to legalize the sale of CBD oil and other cannabis-based compounds in food and beverages in a move that could remove one of the last remaining legal hurdles for companies hoping to sell such products across state lines.

31,Angelica LaVito,Juul combats criticism with ad campaign of smokers switching to e-cigs,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/07/juul-highlights-smokers-switching-to-e-cigarettes-in-ad-campaign.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Juul, the e-cigarette company that has become ubiquitous among teens, is launching its first television ad campaign targeting adult smokers as it faces criticism that its fruity flavors are designed for underaged users. The San Francisco-based e-cigarette company plans to launch over the summer its new TV campaign, featuring testimonials from adults who have used Juul to stop smoking cigarettes, executives said. The ads are likely to draw some controversy. Tobacco companies have long been restricted from most TV or print advertising, with marketing regulations stretching back to the 1970s. Federal and state regulators haven't yet applied the same standards to e-cigarettes, which are a relatively new product. Juul will initially spend almost $10 million for TV slots airing on national cable channels after 10 p.m. local time. The ads, a series of three different commercials, are aimed at adults 35 years and older, executives said. The 60-second spots feature three former smokers between the ages of 37 and 54 who talk about their experience with cigarettes, including how smoking strained relationships or isolated them from families and friends, and how Juul helped them quit smoking. The campaign marks the start of a year Juul will need to spend proving to regulators its product is ending up where its supposed to — in the hands of adult smokers, not teenagers. And fresh with nearly $13 billion in cash from Marlboro-maker Altria, Juul has money to spend to try to change minds that it's not the second coming of Big Tobacco. ""It's clear that we're focused on the mission of the company to convert people off combustible cigarettes,"" said Ann Hoey, Juul's vice president of marketing. ""This is campaign that is a sort of an honest, straight down the middle of the fairway, very clear communication about what we're trying to do as a company."" Juul says its target audience is adults who want to stop smoking cigarettes, but its product has become wildly popular among teens and young adults. Critics have pointed to Juul's first ad campaign, which featured bright colors and youthful looking models, as evidence the company was intentionally marketing to young people. Juul has said it regrets the ads but denies it intentionally targeted teenagers. The company started overhauling its social media accounts last year to highlight testimonials from adults who had switched. It shut down its accounts in the fall facing a threat from the Food and Drug Administration to fix the ""epidemic"" of youth e-cigarette use or else have products pulled from the market. Juul has already captured about 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data. However, it's unclear what percent of Juul's sales comes from former adult smokers and what percent comes teens, though critics would say too much comes from the latter group. In running advertisements highlighting stories of adults who have used Juul to stop smoking, it suggests the company sees an opportunity to reach more adult smokers. Over the past year, Juul captured 68 percent of the total $3.25 billion e-cigarette market, according to Nielsen data ended Dec. 29 compiled by Wells Fargo's Bonnie Herzog. However, it represented just 3 percent of the $72.81 billion in overall tobacco sales, which includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and cigars, according to Nielsen. Altria, maker of best-selling cigarette brand Marlboro, announced Dec. 20 that it bought a 35 percent stake in Juul for nearly $13 billion in cash. As part of the deal, Altria will give Juul some of its prime shelf space and add information about Juul to cigarette packs.",MO

(NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235254-altria-offering-7_1-percent-dividend-yield-first-time-nearly-decade?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months and is now trading at a 4-year low.The stock is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade.The article discusses whether the stock has become a bargain.Since Altria (NYSE:MO) peaked, in the summer of 2017, it has shed 42%. Even more surprisingly, the stock has plunged 31% in the last two and a half months. This is a very unusual move for this low-beta, slow-moving stock, which is well-known for its defensive characteristics even during bear markets. Due to this poor stock price performance, the tobacco giant is now trading at a 4-year low and is offering a 7.1% dividend yield for the first time in nearly a decade. The big question is whether the stock has become a great bargain.The headwinds1. Rising interest ratesMost investors have focused on the challenges facing the business of Altria in order to understand the reasons behind the downtrend of its stock. Nevertheless, they should realize that the environment of rising interest rates, which has nothing to do with the tobacco industry, is a strong headwind for the stock. As most of the shareholders of Altria are holding the stock for its generous and growing dividend, the stock is adversely affected by rising rates, which enable investors to find decent yields elsewhere and thus exert pressure on the valuation of the stock. It is thus only natural that the stock peaked in the summer of 2017, when interest rates were still near record-low levels.On the other hand, the Fed has raised interest rates too aggressively. Notably, its latest hike caused panic in the investing community over a potential recession within the next two years and thus triggered a market sell-off. Since then, Fed officials have been trying to alleviate the market with dovish comments. The Fed is thus likely to slow its pace of interest rate hikes from now on. Moreover, if a recession shows up, interest rates will decrease. Overall, this headwind is not likely to exert additional pressure on the stock for the foreseeable future.2. Acquisition of a stake in JUULWhile rising interest rates have weighed on Altria, another important factor behind its recent plunge is its acquisition of a stake in JUUL (JUUL), the e-vapor leader. Last month, Altria acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 B, thus valuing the company at $38 B. This amount is almost 2.5 times the $16 B valuation JUUL achieved in an investment round six months earlier and is also approximately 38 times the annual revenues of the e-vapor leader.It thus became evident that Altria was willing to purchase a significant stake in its competitor without paying any attention to the valuation. Consequently, the market perceived the deal as a desperate move of Altria to contain its losses from the transition of smokers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. The market also viewed the deal price as an admission of defeat of Altria. After the announcement of the deal, Citi downgraded Altria from ""neutral"" to ""sell"" and cut its price target from $67 to $45 due to the shareholder value destruction that resulted from the sky-high price of the deal.However, it is important to note that Altria essentially hedged its portfolio against the transition of consumers from traditional cigarettes to vaping products. In other words, the tobacco giant essentially bought insurance for its business. Thanks to this insurance, it has drastically reduced its exposure to the headwinds facing its traditional products. In addition, as JUUL seems to have ample room to grow for many more years, the 35% stake in the company may begin to generate a significant income stream for Altria at some point in the future.Some investors are also concerned over the high amount of debt that will result from this deal. However, Altria has always spent minimal amounts on capital expenses. To be sure, its capital expenses have been less than 5% of its operating cash flows every single year in the last decade. As a result, the company enjoys excessive free cash flows, which can be used for shareholder distributions and debt reduction.",MO

Tiger Global's hedge fund invests some $8 billion in assets and gained 0.9 percent in December. That compares with the fortunes of many hedge funds that lost money in December and saw their gains for the year wiped out. A Tiger Global spokeswoman declined to comment. 2018 was a second straight year of strong returns for Tiger Global after its hedge fund gained 28.2 percent in 2017. The average stocks-oriented hedge fund lost 6.9 percent last year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Tiger Global, founded by Chase Coleman in 2001, has historically invested in technology companies and got a boost from betting that companies would fall, or shorting, in 2018. Performance was also fueled by bets on Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.. The firm also got a boost from its investment in e-cigarette maker Juul Labs Inc.

(NYSE:MO) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235267-altria-shares-now-pricing-risk?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryAltria shares sold off quite hard due to an analyst downgrade and news of FDA scrutiny on the e-cigarette market.While I believe the company does face significant pressure in its core business, at this point, the risk may be priced in.Management has made questionable moves, but for investors willing to take risk and collect a dividend, now may be the time to start a position. SourceI have been openly taking the opposing view on Seeking Alpha as many investors believe Altria (MO) can do no wrong. In December, I wrote an article stating that Altria was cheap and offered a nice yield. (See: Altria Is Cheap With A Juicy Yield). Shortly thereafter, I sold my shares luckily before they dropped. I believed the deals they made were quite expensive and offered little immediate ROI. While the deal would have been good for the company at a lower price or better terms, this just doesn't seem attractive for shareholders at this price. In fact, I was looking forward to the deals Altria was going to make in both the marijuana space and the e-cigarette space. That being said, I believe even with a negative, forward-looking story, there becomes a point where the shares price in the risk and are worth what I would call a speculative buy. We shall review the deals again below and why the valuation seems enticing here.Acquisitions At A Cost Source: Seeking AlphaPaying $12.8 billion for a non-controlling stake in a company is certainly concerning. It is more concerning that this seems rather high considering this pegs the company with a value of $38 billion when it was valued at $16 billion only in the middle of this year. What I can judge from this is that the existing owners of JUUL (JUUL) did not value Altria and/or find it necessary to bring it in as a partner. They apparently were only interested in doing so at quite a premium to the last funding valuation. This is intriguing considering the extensive knowledge, distribution, and marketing power Altria has to offer. However, it is apparent that Altria wanted access to JUUL and was willing to pay anything for it. Altria now has faced a credit rating downgrade that leaves it with a BBB rating from S&amp;P. Moody's also cut its rating with a negative outlook alongside. This is due to the $15 billion being spent on deals in the last two months.Now, I do believe Altria is doing its best to be with the times and increase its reduced-risk portfolio as it has seen significant volume declines in its core business. However, it needs to do so in a manner that does not come across as desperate. How desperate is the management team that it was willing to pay 19x sales for a stake in a vaping company? Yes, the company is growing rather rapidly, but as the law of large numbers works, the sales growth will slow down. I am sure management has identified what it considers a market opportunity, but it is impossible to estimate what percentage of smokers will transition from combustible products to a vaporizing product. It is also notable that this transition will only cause share loss from Marlboro products. As Marlboro has a market-leading share, it stands to lose the most in the smokable category. According to Forbes, Marlboro had a 43.3% market share in 2017. Furthermore, the company may be promoting what could be an easier way for cigarette users to find an outlet to quit. A transition to a vaping product may allow for an easier out or quitting process of nicotine down the road as it has been proven to do. As noted in this article, which focuses on a study shows, vaping may lead to an easier route to quitting.While I appreciate the management team at Altria looking to participate in the future, I worry at what price, as stated above. Looking into the details of the deal, the company...""...will be subject to a standstill agreement under which it may not acquire additional JUUL shares above its 35% interest. Altria agrees not to sell or transfer any JUUL common shares for six years from closing."" - SourceThis agreement is of particular concern and seemed to be missed by many. Essentially, the company cannot gain the right to maintain a majority share for six years. While this may sound okay, it could come at an even costlier expense to shareholders, as the company would be worth more should sales continue to grow from today's pace. Even a simple double in valuation in the next six years, which seems practical considering the double in the last six months that Altria was willing to pay, would lead to a $76 billion valuation. And while this would obviously make Altria's existing stake very valuable, we must be clear in understanding that to acquire a controlling interest or even 16% of the company, it could cost Altria another $12+ billion. And, presumably, there would not be many in the market for a stake in JUUL at a valuation larger than even the one paid by Altria today.",MO

Barr is scheduled to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee next week for two days of confirmation hearings. Ahead of that, he has submitted financial disclosure forms, as required. Some of the forms, seen by Reuters, describe sizeable investments in stocks, bonds and real estate. Among his holdings are $1.2 million worth of shares in telecommunications and media company AT&amp;T. He served on the board of Time Warner, which was acquired by AT&amp;T last year, from 2009 until 2018. The Justice Department, which Barr would lead as attorney general, fought and lost a court battle to block the $85 billion deal and has appealed the decision. Barr told Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar he would recuse himself from that effort if he were confirmed, Klobuchar said. ""He told me he was going to recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T appeal because he was involved in that, the Time Warner side,"" Klobuchar told reporters after meeting with Barr. She added that she plans to review his financial disclosures more carefully over the weekend. A Justice Department official, familiar with Barr's confirmation preparation, confirmed that he plans to recuse himself from the matter. Barr is set to face tough questioning in the confirmation hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday from Democrats who have raised concerns about his past criticism of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Senators who will vet his nomination will likely closely examine the disclosures, which trickled in later than usual on Thursday due to a partial government shutdown which has furloughed many of the government's ethics attorneys. According to the documents, Barr owns about $16 million worth of stocks and bonds, as well as another $8 million in private investments and $4.2 million in real estate. As of December 14, he held $2.8 million worth of Dominion Energy stock, his largest holding. Barr served on Dominion's board of directors, as well. Under federal ethics rules, Barr will be required to divest certain holdings if they conflict with particular matters he is working on at the Justice Department. Presidential nominees also must sign an ethics pledge that spells out how potential conflicts will be managed. Other stocks in his portfolio include tobacco company Altria and drugmakers Merck and Pfizer. Reuters could not immediately determine which assets, if any, he may need to divest, but the same Justice Department official said government ethics lawyers are working on a divestment plan. Barr will also be required to disclose some details about which clients he or his law firm have recently represented in order to avoid potential conflicts. In his questionnaire to the Senate, he disclosed he represented construction machinery and equipment maker Caterpillar in 2017 in connection with a Justice Department grand jury probe and recently was retained to provide regulatory advice for the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Other possible conflict questions that could come up include the fact that his daughter and both of his sons-in-law currently work at the Justice Department.",MO

The uptick in vape usage has undercut and even eclipsed progress in reducing cigarette smoking, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says. Federal data showed teen use of e-cigarettes skyrocketed last year, prompting the surgeon general to declare it an ""epidemic"" and Gottlieb demanding manufacturers to fix it. Juul, the market leader, suspended sales of its fruity flavors in stores ahead of the FDA effectively pulling these products from convenience stores and limiting them to age-restricted stores like vape shops. Despite these efforts, anecdotal reports suggest some teenagers find themselves hooked on nicotine and unable to stop using e-cigarettes. Doctors treating kids don't have much information on how to properly treat them since the cessation products available today, like nicotine patches and gums, are meant only for adults. The agency put out the call for insight months ago and is holding a rescheduled public hearing on Friday at its Silver Spring, Maryland headquarters. ""For these addicted young people, the reasons that they tried e-cigarettes may not matter anymore,"" Gottlieb said in prepared remarks. ""These young people are hooked on vaping, and their worried parents, physicians, and the public health community are searching for tools to help them quit."" E-cigarettes are billed as a way to help smokers get their nicotine fix without all the toxins that come with smoking cigarettes. However, the surge in young people using e-cigarettes has enraged parents, teachers and now even regulators. Gottlieb believes in e-cigarettes as a way to help adult smokers. But on Friday, he said the industry will face an ""existential threat"" if the number of teens using e-cigarettes does not decrease in this year's survey data. If the trends don't improve, he said, the conversation will shift from where fruity flavors can be sold to whether e-cigarettes can stay on the market. Gottlieb again dangled the threat of reversing a decision that allowed e-cigarettes to stay on the market. Products that were on the market before Aug. 8, 2016, were supposed to start undergoing review this year until Gottlieb extended the deadline until Aug. 8, 2022, so manufacturers would have more time to file complete applications. ""It will be 'game over' for these products until they can successfully traverse the regulatory process,"" Gottlieb said. ""I think the stakes are that high. And would be a blow for all of the currently addicted adult smokers who, I believe, could potentially benefit from these products."" Gottlieb met with executives from five major manufacturers in the fall and plans to send follow-up meeting requests to the leaders of Altria and Juul. In December, Marlboro-maker Altria invested nearly $13 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul. Two months earlier, Altria said it would voluntarily pull its flavors and pod-based products, saying these features, which Juul popularized, drove the surge in young people using e-cigarettes. ""I have real questions about whether there's consistency,"" Gottlieb told CNBC in an interview last week. Juul in a statement said it's moving ""full steam ahead"" on implementing the action plan it announced in November to prevent minors from using its products.  ""We will be a transparent, engaged, and committed partner with FDA, state Attorneys General, local municipalities, and community organizations in the effort to combat underage use,"" a spokesman said in a statement.  In the meantime, the FDA wants to find ways to stop teens from using e-cigarettes. Treatments for nicotine addiction on the market today are intended for adults, not minors. Pfizer's Chantix, a prescription drug to help adult smokers quit, failed a clinical trial last year studying whether it worked for teen smokers. Researchers, public health groups and vaping associations are slated to make presentations at Friday's hearing, though one group is noticeably absent from the agenda: drugmakers. Everyone who requested to give a formal presentation or share comments during the open session made it onto the agenda, the FDA said, meaning drug companies did not ask to participate.

There have been hundreds of articles written on this stock all over the internet. In any case, it does not seem to make sense that few months after it completed its IPO at US$17 per share, the stock could reach as high as US$300 at one point. We have told readers that a fair price would have been US$30 - $40 when the cannabis market was red hot. However, without too much attention, Tilray's stock has actually been slowly deflating. The stock closed around US$70 last week, trading ""just 4x"" above the IPO price and down ~80% from its all-time high. (Source: Bloomberg)In the meantime, Tilray has announced a US$100 million joint research project with AB InBev (BUD) that had little impact on the stock. The weak Q3 reported by the company did not help either, as investors reassess the then-most expensive stock on earth to see how much it's actually worth. The largest private shareholder of Tilray, Privateer, recently announced that it doesn't intend to sell any of the 75 million shares it owns in 1H 2019.

It likely did face pressures of acting, in case some other tobacco company moved first. But by doing so, it created the typical first mover disadvantage at likely the worst possible time. The value destruction is obvious to us. That said, MO is now at a reasonable valuation where the risks of declining sales and even the silly acquisition are priced in. We were negative on the stock earlier and now think that it is much closer to fair value.Source: Altria: I Pity The Fool Who Paid $36 Billion For JUULSince then, the stock has continued to tumble with Morgan Stanley's (MS) latest note striking more panic in the heart of bulls. The recent FDA speech made even the most ardent bulls take notice that the FDA is now very close to intervening in the market. The key takeaways from that speech were, FDA is concerned by an alarming rise in use of e-cigarettes, particularly JUUL among teenagers. From 2017 to 2018, there was a 78% increase in current e-cigarette use among high school students and a 48% increase among middle school students. The total number of middle and high school students currently using e-cigarettes rose to 3.6 million — that’s 1.5 million more students using these products than the previous year. FDA has already taken steps to address this and basically will not stop until this trend is reversed. If that means a complete ban of e-cigarettes, they are ready to go there. While investors may downplay that a complete ban will not happen, absolutely any kind of containment of JUUL growth means Altria will be taking an epic write-down.When you pay nosebleed valuations, things better work out wellWe had recently made the comment on NVDIA (NVDA) that things never work out for investors when they purchase a large cap stock at 15X sales. NVDA is at about half that price currently.Altria's purchase price valued JUUL at 36X sales. The total enterprise value of JUUL would make it a large cap, making disappointment guaranteed for Altria. But in Altria's case the write-down will come when the auditors give their opinion at the next annual report. The reasons are quite obvious here. Altria has acquired the JUUL stake just when JUUL was growing at close to 800%. At that point, JUUL’s dollar sales had skyrocketed 783 percent in the 52 weeks ended June 16, reaching $942.6 million, according to a Wells Fargo analysis of Nielsen data. The e-cigarette category as a whole grew 97 percent to $1.96 billion in the same period. JUUL now represents more than 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, according to the Nielsen numbers. Essentially, JUUL sales grew from $106.79 million to $942.6 million.In other words, JUUL accounted for 85% of the total growth in e-cigarettes. It is obvious why the FDA is specifically targeting JUUL. JUUL is not part of the problem, it is the problem. But more from the point of Altria's investment, we can extrapolate a few numbers to see how this will play out. To do that we will have to make some assumptions about JUUL's profitability. Considering JUUL itself is private, we will use Altria's numbers to help out.Altria itself reports rather strong gross margins and operating margins. Source: Altria 2017 annual report2017 was the best year for Altria with a rather hefty 37% operating margin. Assuming JUUL can reach the same economies of scale and is not threatened by competition, we can assume similar operating margins for it. Taking a step forward, a 30% net after tax margin is not big stretch either. These assumptions are optimistic as even if e-cigarettes are not banned JUUL will have more competition than the existing companies in the dying tobacco industry face today.All industries mature at some point and some even go into terminal decline.

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee.""

1,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy.

Intel said weaker demand from China hurt the company's data center chip business, which has driven growth in recent years as PC sales have slowed and cloud-based services have become more popular. In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time ""digesting"" the chips as they build out their centers. Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips sooner than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added. ""I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,"" Swan said. ""But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been. We're just in a digesting period."" For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple's iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier. But it was the sole provider of 2018 iPhone modems, which help the phones connect to wireless data networks, and earlier this month, Apple cut its revenue forecast, citing weak demand in China.

6,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer: Here are 7 shutdown-proof investing themes,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/cramer-here-are-7-shutdown-proof-investing-themes.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"This earnings season is far enough along that investors can start making judgments about which stock market sectors are on the rise and which ones could see weakness in the better part of 2019, says CNBC's Jim Cramer. ""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months."" The analysts wrote that Intel faces stiff competition from Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. Watch:

12,Theory of Living Investments,Should I Be Aiming To Buy Target? - Portfolio January 2019 Update - Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4234996-aiming-buy-target-portfolio-january-2019-update?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryTarget was beaten up on the heels of its most recent earnings and has traded sideways since. Target's last five years have not been pretty, and its future in large part depends on growth of its e-commerce platform. Target is making progress, and I think it is worth a measured bet. The Making Money While I Sleep Portfolio's January buys are in. Owners of Target (TGT) stock have taken a beating as the merchandiser’s shares have been whacked to the tune nearly 20% since mid November.Ouch.Shares first started to fall in early November, but things really got going when the retailer released its 11/20 earnings report which was… ummm… not well received. Shares fell 7% on the back of the report and have traded sideways since.Target is a blue chip company with a fantastic track record. When a stock like that takes a whack, it behooves investors to do some analysis. Is this company on sale, or is it stock on the receiving end of a well deserved valuation adjustment?Keeping an eye on beaten up blue chips has served me well, helping me get into Starbucks at a fantastic price. The trick, however, is to avoid the falling knife.I’ll give you the short version: if you think Target is going to start growing, you should buy here. If not, stay away.Valuation and GrowthTarget trades at a PE ratio of 11.7. On the surface, this is an attractive number, but a key piece of any valuation is the company’s expected future growth. It would seem Mr. Market is not impressed by Target’s growth prospects.Is this fair?Well… yeah, if history is any guide. Target has spent the last five years providing shareholders with exactly what it is priced for: no meaningful growth in sales or earnings.Revenue has been stagnant at a little over $70 billion since 2013, and the lack of growth holds down to the bottom line. Just check out the two graphs from Target’s 2017 annual report. Notice anything? And don’t bother looking too hard.In fact, if I notice anything, it’s the uncomfortable feeling I get in my stomach from eyeing these charts. The trend line is flat, the 5-year CAGR is negative, and none of these things make me feel happy thoughts as a potential investor.That is why Target trades at a depressed valuation multiple.The question becomes whether the multiple has been punished enough, and, more importantly, whether the company will be able to get the “E” portion moving in coming years. I’m not interested in holding a growthless company for the long run, no matter how good the dividend or how low the PE ratio. If Target can return to growth, the market will sort out the rest.A lot has been written of Target’s attempts to rejuvenate brands and improve the in store experience, and I’m not going to dig into that here. The elephant in the room is the online retail space. Target would be just fine in a world without Amazon (AMZN). However, the threat is real, and Target has long been behind in the online weapons race, thousands of miles behind Amazon and well behind comparable retailer Walmart (WMT).E-commerceWhile starting from behind, Target isn’t taking the e-commerce hits lying down. The company is pushing hard to catch up. In fact, in the last quarter, online sales for Target increased 49% year over year.",NVDA

The company also said Thursday it has lost $10 million to $15 million this month due the partial government shutdown. Union Pacific Corporation — Shares of Union Pacific jumped 3 percent after the railroad reported adjusted earnings of $2.12 per share , easily topping an estimate of $2.06 per share. The company also beat on the top line with sales of $5.757 billion against consensus estimates of $5.74 billion. Canada Goose — Shares of apparel maker Canada Goose dropped more than 10 percent after an analyst at Wells Fargo downgraded them to market perform from outperform. The analyst cited a high valuation among the reasons for the downgrade. American Airlines — The airline company's shares jumped Thursday after it projected higher 2019 profits than Wall Street expected and reported fourth-quarter profit that topped estimates. American also said its revenue for each seat it flies a mile will be flat to up 2 percent in the first quarter of the year. Freeport-McMoRan — Freeport-McMoRan dropped more than 9 percent after the company's quarterly earnings missed expectations. The company said its results were affected by a drop in copper prices in the fourth quarter.

Ford Motor Company — Shares of the longtime automaker rose 3 percent after the company posted stronger-than-expected sales in the fourth quarter.

The company's shares fell 7.7 percent in extended trading and also undid part of a chip stock rally earlier in the day following better-than-feared quarterly results from a clutch of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy. Reports that Apple is reducing planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter weighed on Intel, which has replaced Qualcomm as the sole supplier of modem chips for the newer phones. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group. Intel has turned to the server chips it supplies data center operators for growth in recent years. However, fourth-quarter revenue in that higher-margin business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. The company said data center missed expectations ""on softer China demand"" and ""cloud deceleration"". Revenue in the company's client computing business, which includes sales to PC makers was $9.82 billion, missing FactSet estimates of $10.01 billion. Intel reported https://bit.ly/2FN4ac0 net income of $5.20 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth-quarter ended Dec. 29, compared with a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $18.66 billion from $17.05 billion, but missed estimates of $19.01 billion. Excluding items, the company earned $1.28 per share, above expectations of $1.22.

15,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

Intel said weaker demand from China hurt the company's data center chip business, which has driven growth in recent years as PC sales have slowed and cloud-based services have become more popular. In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time ""digesting"" the chips as they build out their centers. Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips sooner than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added. ""I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,"" Swan said. ""But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been. We're just in a digesting period."" For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple's iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier. But it was the sole provider of 2018 iPhone modems, which help the phones connect to wireless data networks, and earlier this month, Apple cut its revenue forecast, citing weak demand in China. Swan said Intel's modem business grew by 60 percent over last year but still came in about $200 million below target. The modem unit had ""fantastic growth, but weaker than we expected, and as a result that impacted our revenues for the quarter,"" Swan said.

""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait."" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Honeywell, Cisco Systems and Five Below. ",NVDA

Jefferies noted that Intel is getting attacked on all sides, including by Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. Some analysts like J.P. Morgan lowered their price targets, while Susquehanna went further saying, ""In short, we are downgrading shares of Intel to neutral on DCG (datacenter group) deceleration, building competitive risks, narrowing process technology leadership, macro concerns, and what we believe is now fair value for a company potentially struggling to grow earnings in 2019.

24,Lauren Feiner,Intel tanks after revenue miss and weak guidance,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/intel-tanks-after-revenue-miss-and-weak-guidance.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Intel shares dropped 5.5 percent Friday following a revenue miss for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2018. Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months."" The analysts wrote that Intel faces stiff competition from Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report. Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube. Watch:

Target's last five years have not been pretty, and its future in large part depends on growth of its e-commerce platform. Target is making progress, and I think it is worth a measured bet. The Making Money While I Sleep Portfolio's January buys are in. Owners of Target (TGT) stock have taken a beating as the merchandiser’s shares have been whacked to the tune nearly 20% since mid November.Ouch.Shares first started to fall in early November, but things really got going when the retailer released its 11/20 earnings report which was… ummm… not well received. Shares fell 7% on the back of the report and have traded sideways since.Target is a blue chip company with a fantastic track record. When a stock like that takes a whack, it behooves investors to do some analysis. Is this company on sale, or is it stock on the receiving end of a well deserved valuation adjustment?Keeping an eye on beaten up blue chips has served me well, helping me get into Starbucks at a fantastic price. The trick, however, is to avoid the falling knife.I’ll give you the short version: if you think Target is going to start growing, you should buy here. If not, stay away.Valuation and GrowthTarget trades at a PE ratio of 11.7. On the surface, this is an attractive number, but a key piece of any valuation is the company’s expected future growth. It would seem Mr. Market is not impressed by Target’s growth prospects.Is this fair?Well… yeah, if history is any guide. Target has spent the last five years providing shareholders with exactly what it is priced for: no meaningful growth in sales or earnings.Revenue has been stagnant at a little over $70 billion since 2013, and the lack of growth holds down to the bottom line. Just check out the two graphs from Target’s 2017 annual report. Notice anything? And don’t bother looking too hard.In fact, if I notice anything, it’s the uncomfortable feeling I get in my stomach from eyeing these charts. The trend line is flat, the 5-year CAGR is negative, and none of these things make me feel happy thoughts as a potential investor.That is why Target trades at a depressed valuation multiple.The question becomes whether the multiple has been punished enough, and, more importantly, whether the company will be able to get the “E” portion moving in coming years. I’m not interested in holding a growthless company for the long run, no matter how good the dividend or how low the PE ratio. If Target can return to growth, the market will sort out the rest.A lot has been written of Target’s attempts to rejuvenate brands and improve the in store experience, and I’m not going to dig into that here. The elephant in the room is the online retail space. Target would be just fine in a world without Amazon (AMZN). However, the threat is real, and Target has long been behind in the online weapons race, thousands of miles behind Amazon and well behind comparable retailer Walmart (WMT).E-commerceWhile starting from behind, Target isn’t taking the e-commerce hits lying down. The company is pushing hard to catch up. In fact, in the last quarter, online sales for Target increased 49% year over year.",NVDA

The company's shares fell 7.7 percent in extended trading and also undid part of a chip stock rally earlier in the day following better-than-feared quarterly results from a clutch of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy. Reports that Apple is reducing planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter weighed on Intel, which has replaced Qualcomm as the sole supplier of modem chips for the newer phones. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group. Intel has turned to the server chips it supplies data center operators for growth in recent years. However, fourth-quarter revenue in that higher-margin business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. The company said data center missed expectations ""on softer China demand"" and ""cloud deceleration"". Revenue in the company's client computing business, which includes sales to PC makers was $9.82 billion, missing FactSet estimates of $10.01 billion.

30,Sonam Rai and Stephen Nellis,UPDATE 3-Weak Intel outlook stokes fears of a chip slowdown,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/reuters-america-update-3-weak-intel-outlook-stokes-fears-of-a-chip-slowdown.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(Adds executive comments, context, updates share prices) Jan 24 (Reuters) - Intel Corp forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below analysts' estimates and missed fourth-quarter sales estimates on Thursday, hit by a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips. The company's shares fell 6.7 percent in extended trading as the news stoked fears of an industry slowdown after sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month pointed to stagnating demand from smartphone makers and a cooling Chinese economy. Shares of smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 1.7 percent, as did Nvidia Corp. Intel said weaker demand from China hurt the company's data center chip business, which has driven growth in recent years as PC sales have slowed and cloud-based services have become more popular. In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time ""digesting"" the chips as they build out their centers. Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips sooner than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added. ""I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,"" Swan said. ""But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been. We're just in a digesting period."" For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple's iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier. But it was the sole provider of 2018 iPhone modems, which help the phones connect to wireless data networks, and earlier this month, Apple cut its revenue forecast, citing weak demand in China. Swan said Intel's modem business grew by 60 percent over last year but still came in about $200 million below target. The modem unit had ""fantastic growth, but weaker than we expected, and as a result that impacted our revenues for the quarter,"" Swan said. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share.

31,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

34,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer: Here are 7 shutdown-proof investing themes,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/cramer-here-are-7-shutdown-proof-investing-themes.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"This earnings season is far enough along that investors can start making judgments about which stock market sectors are on the rise and which ones could see weakness in the better part of 2019, says CNBC's Jim Cramer. ""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said.

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

39,Theory of Living Investments,Should I Be Aiming To Buy Target? - Portfolio January 2019 Update - Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4234996-aiming-buy-target-portfolio-january-2019-update?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryTarget was beaten up on the heels of its most recent earnings and has traded sideways since. Target's last five years have not been pretty, and its future in large part depends on growth of its e-commerce platform. Target is making progress, and I think it is worth a measured bet. The Making Money While I Sleep Portfolio's January buys are in. Owners of Target (TGT) stock have taken a beating as the merchandiser’s shares have been whacked to the tune nearly 20% since mid November.Ouch.Shares first started to fall in early November, but things really got going when the retailer released its 11/20 earnings report which was… ummm… not well received. Shares fell 7% on the back of the report and have traded sideways since.Target is a blue chip company with a fantastic track record. When a stock like that takes a whack, it behooves investors to do some analysis. Is this company on sale, or is it stock on the receiving end of a well deserved valuation adjustment?Keeping an eye on beaten up blue chips has served me well, helping me get into Starbucks at a fantastic price. The trick, however, is to avoid the falling knife.I’ll give you the short version: if you think Target is going to start growing, you should buy here. If not, stay away.Valuation and GrowthTarget trades at a PE ratio of 11.7. On the surface, this is an attractive number, but a key piece of any valuation is the company’s expected future growth. It would seem Mr. Market is not impressed by Target’s growth prospects.Is this fair?Well… yeah, if history is any guide. Target has spent the last five years providing shareholders with exactly what it is priced for: no meaningful growth in sales or earnings.Revenue has been stagnant at a little over $70 billion since 2013, and the lack of growth holds down to the bottom line. Just check out the two graphs from Target’s 2017 annual report. Notice anything? And don’t bother looking too hard.In fact, if I notice anything, it’s the uncomfortable feeling I get in my stomach from eyeing these charts. The trend line is flat, the 5-year CAGR is negative, and none of these things make me feel happy thoughts as a potential investor.That is why Target trades at a depressed valuation multiple.The question becomes whether the multiple has been punished enough, and, more importantly, whether the company will be able to get the “E” portion moving in coming years. I’m not interested in holding a growthless company for the long run, no matter how good the dividend or how low the PE ratio. If Target can return to growth, the market will sort out the rest.A lot has been written of Target’s attempts to rejuvenate brands and improve the in store experience, and I’m not going to dig into that here. The elephant in the room is the online retail space. Target would be just fine in a world without Amazon (AMZN). However, the threat is real, and Target has long been behind in the online weapons race, thousands of miles behind Amazon and well behind comparable retailer Walmart (WMT).E-commerceWhile starting from behind, Target isn’t taking the e-commerce hits lying down. The company is pushing hard to catch up. In fact, in the last quarter, online sales for Target increased 49% year over year.",NVDA

The company also beat on the top line with sales of $5.757 billion against consensus estimates of $5.74 billion. Canada Goose — Shares of apparel maker Canada Goose dropped more than 10 percent after an analyst at Wells Fargo downgraded them to market perform from outperform. The analyst cited a high valuation among the reasons for the downgrade.

The company's shares fell 7.7 percent in extended trading and also undid part of a chip stock rally earlier in the day following better-than-feared quarterly results from a clutch of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy. Reports that Apple is reducing planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter weighed on Intel, which has replaced Qualcomm as the sole supplier of modem chips for the newer phones. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share.

42,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

Jefferies noted that Intel is getting attacked on all sides, including by Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. Some analysts like J.P. Morgan lowered their price targets, while Susquehanna went further saying, ""In short, we are downgrading shares of Intel to neutral on DCG (datacenter group) deceleration, building competitive risks, narrowing process technology leadership, macro concerns, and what we believe is now fair value for a company potentially struggling to grow earnings in 2019.

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

53,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

The company's shares fell 7.7 percent in extended trading and also undid part of a chip stock rally earlier in the day following better-than-feared quarterly results from a clutch of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy. Reports that Apple is reducing planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter weighed on Intel, which has replaced Qualcomm as the sole supplier of modem chips for the newer phones. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share.

In an interview, Intel Interim Chief Executive Bob Swan said data center providers tend to make large purchases in spurts and then spend time ""digesting"" the chips as they build out their centers. Sales in China fell because some buyers there - especially cloud computing vendors - seem to have bought chips sooner than usual last year because of fears about U.S.-China trade tensions, Swan said. U.S. cloud computing vendors continued their usual buying patterns throughout the year, he added. ""I do believe there was earlier buying (among Chinese cloud customers) for server-type products in the course of the second and third quarter of last year,"" Swan said. ""But overall I would say ... the prospects and the health of the industry are as bright as they've ever been. We're just in a digesting period."" For years, Intel had been insulated from swings in Apple's iPhone supply chain because it was not a major supplier.

""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

Wall Street largely believes the company's sales shortfall is an Intel-specific problem and they remain bullish on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Shares were down over 7 percent at the open after the company also gave weak guidance and missed on revenue and didn't seem any closer to naming a permanent CEO. Jefferies noted that Intel is getting attacked on all sides, including by Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. Some analysts like J.P. Morgan lowered their price targets, while Susquehanna went further saying, ""In short, we are downgrading shares of Intel to neutral on DCG (datacenter group) deceleration, building competitive risks, narrowing process technology leadership, macro concerns, and what we believe is now fair value for a company potentially struggling to grow earnings in 2019.

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

62,"Stephen Simpson, CFA","Xilinx Emerges As A Semiconductor Unicorn And Shivs The Shorts - Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235602-xilinx-emerges-semiconductor-unicorn-shivs-shorts?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryXilinx zigs while the rest of the semiconductor zags, as 5G, broadcast, data center, and aero/defense drive 34% yoy revenue growth, a strong beat versus expectations, and an upward revision.Xilinx is looking at significant opportunities across its end-markets, including 5G, ADAS/autonomous driving, machine vision/factory automation, and AI inference.With the big post-earnings spike, Xilinx shares look basically fairly-valued, albeit with exceptional momentum in the business.Not too many semiconductor stocks have reported as of this writing, but with the Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) reports in, it looks like the market's fears of another round of downward guidance revisions for the first quarter are materializing. But then, there's Xilinx (XLNX) - quite possibly a true unicorn this quarter in not only reporting very strong growth (revenue up 34% yoy and 7% qoq) but also guiding UP for the next quarter.With strong earnings and the 5G opportunity seeming to come through sooner than expected, Xilinx shares shot up almost 20% and set a new 52-week high. Xilinx has a legitimate, differentiated opportunity with its strong FPGA and FPGA/SoC portfolio, including near-term opportunities like 5G wireless and auto ADAS and longer-term opportunities like data center/AI and autonomous driving. Although I think Xilinx can generate double-digit long-term revenue growth and that today's DCF-based fair value isn't unreasonable, it's certainly not an overlooked opportunity at this point.Great Numbers For The December QuarterXilinx reported 34% yoy and 7% qoq revenue growth for the December quarter (the company's fiscal third quarter), beating expectations by 4%.Although the company saw weaker demand from industrial customers and only flat sales to the auto sector, it hardly mattered. Communications revenue jumped 41% as the company is seeing broadening 5G deployments beyond South Korea (Texas Instruments management said they believe North American deployments have begun). Industrial, Aero, &amp; Defense revenue rose 18% as stronger aerospace and defense demand counterbalanced weakness in factory automation and industrial IoT (hardly a surprise, given recent comments from Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) and Nidec (OTCPK:NJDCY)). Datacenter and TME revenue was up 14%, which bodes well for Agilent (A), and revenue in the Broadcast, Consumer, and Auto market was up 20% on strength in broadcast.A mix shift toward communications has implications for margins, and gross margin declined 130bp year over year (flat sequentially), which was in line with expectations (arguably a beat, in effect, the unexpectedly high level of Communications revenue). Operating income rose 61% yoy and 11% qoq, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding by 550bp yoy (and 120bp qoq), helping drive a bottom-line beat.Better still, management gave strong guidance for the March quarter. Calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the next quarter, Xilinx set a target about 6% above the prior average sell-side estimate.Plenty Of Room To RunWith the 5G ramp just beginning, Xilinx is in the early days of a market opportunity that could see its served addressable market grow by more than $2 billion over the next four years (to over $7 billion), with more FPGAs going into both radios and baseband. If there's a ""but"", it is likely concern that deployments could take longer than expected (which I don't consider probable) and/or that ASICs will eventually spoil the party. That has been the basic history of FPGAs - great growth eventually disrupted by the eventual introduction of lower-priced ASICs. Although that will probably happen here too, it will take a while.And 5G isn't the only thing Xilinx has going for it. The data center business is only about 5% of revenue now, even though Xilinx scored some early wins with Amazon (AMZN) (while Microsoft (MSFT) has gone with Intel/Altera). Xilinx has seen multiple hyperscale wins for its Smart NICs, though, and the new Alveo and ""AI Core"" chips should make Xilinx a legitimate competitor alongside Nvidia (NVDA) in AI inference - a market currently served mostly by Intel Xeon chips, but that could be worth over $6 billion in 2025 (according to SIG analyst Christopher Rolland) and where I/O fabric, cache size, and programmability are key factors (and where the single-chip ASPs are startlingly high).Auto, too, is a significant opportunity. About half of Xilinx's current auto revenue (around 3% to 4% of total revenue) comes from ADAS, where Xilinx is the #2 supplier today, and where expectations are for exceptional content growth over the next 10 years as cars incorporate more safety and assistance features on the path to partial or fully autonomous driving. This is perhaps one of the most uncertain markets for Xilinx, as there are so many chip companies throwing their hats into this rink (including Nvidia, Intel, and Renesas (OTCPK:RNECY) among others).",NVDA

The company's shares fell 7.7 percent in extended trading and also undid part of a chip stock rally earlier in the day following better-than-feared quarterly results from a clutch of companies such as Texas Instruments Inc, Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. Smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices, which reports results next Tuesday, dropped 2 percent, while Nvidia fell 1 percent. Sales warnings from Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Co Ltd earlier this month had pointed to stagnating smartphone demand and a cooling Chinese economy. Reports that Apple is reducing planned production for its three new iPhone models by about 10 percent for the January-March quarter weighed on Intel, which has replaced Qualcomm as the sole supplier of modem chips for the newer phones. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group.

66,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

76,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

80,"Stephen Simpson, CFA","Xilinx Emerges As A Semiconductor Unicorn And Shivs The Shorts - Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235602-xilinx-emerges-semiconductor-unicorn-shivs-shorts?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryXilinx zigs while the rest of the semiconductor zags, as 5G, broadcast, data center, and aero/defense drive 34% yoy revenue growth, a strong beat versus expectations, and an upward revision.Xilinx is looking at significant opportunities across its end-markets, including 5G, ADAS/autonomous driving, machine vision/factory automation, and AI inference.With the big post-earnings spike, Xilinx shares look basically fairly-valued, albeit with exceptional momentum in the business.Not too many semiconductor stocks have reported as of this writing, but with the Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) reports in, it looks like the market's fears of another round of downward guidance revisions for the first quarter are materializing. But then, there's Xilinx (XLNX) - quite possibly a true unicorn this quarter in not only reporting very strong growth (revenue up 34% yoy and 7% qoq) but also guiding UP for the next quarter.With strong earnings and the 5G opportunity seeming to come through sooner than expected, Xilinx shares shot up almost 20% and set a new 52-week high. Xilinx has a legitimate, differentiated opportunity with its strong FPGA and FPGA/SoC portfolio, including near-term opportunities like 5G wireless and auto ADAS and longer-term opportunities like data center/AI and autonomous driving. Although I think Xilinx can generate double-digit long-term revenue growth and that today's DCF-based fair value isn't unreasonable, it's certainly not an overlooked opportunity at this point.Great Numbers For The December QuarterXilinx reported 34% yoy and 7% qoq revenue growth for the December quarter (the company's fiscal third quarter), beating expectations by 4%.Although the company saw weaker demand from industrial customers and only flat sales to the auto sector, it hardly mattered. Communications revenue jumped 41% as the company is seeing broadening 5G deployments beyond South Korea (Texas Instruments management said they believe North American deployments have begun). Industrial, Aero, &amp; Defense revenue rose 18% as stronger aerospace and defense demand counterbalanced weakness in factory automation and industrial IoT (hardly a surprise, given recent comments from Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) and Nidec (OTCPK:NJDCY)). Datacenter and TME revenue was up 14%, which bodes well for Agilent (A), and revenue in the Broadcast, Consumer, and Auto market was up 20% on strength in broadcast.A mix shift toward communications has implications for margins, and gross margin declined 130bp year over year (flat sequentially), which was in line with expectations (arguably a beat, in effect, the unexpectedly high level of Communications revenue). Operating income rose 61% yoy and 11% qoq, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding by 550bp yoy (and 120bp qoq), helping drive a bottom-line beat.Better still, management gave strong guidance for the March quarter. Calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the next quarter, Xilinx set a target about 6% above the prior average sell-side estimate.Plenty Of Room To RunWith the 5G ramp just beginning, Xilinx is in the early days of a market opportunity that could see its served addressable market grow by more than $2 billion over the next four years (to over $7 billion), with more FPGAs going into both radios and baseband. If there's a ""but"", it is likely concern that deployments could take longer than expected (which I don't consider probable) and/or that ASICs will eventually spoil the party. That has been the basic history of FPGAs - great growth eventually disrupted by the eventual introduction of lower-priced ASICs. Although that will probably happen here too, it will take a while.And 5G isn't the only thing Xilinx has going for it. The data center business is only about 5% of revenue now, even though Xilinx scored some early wins with Amazon (AMZN) (while Microsoft (MSFT) has gone with Intel/Altera). Xilinx has seen multiple hyperscale wins for its Smart NICs, though, and the new Alveo and ""AI Core"" chips should make Xilinx a legitimate competitor alongside Nvidia (NVDA) in AI inference - a market currently served mostly by Intel Xeon chips, but that could be worth over $6 billion in 2025 (according to SIG analyst Christopher Rolland) and where I/O fabric, cache size, and programmability are key factors (and where the single-chip ASPs are startlingly high).Auto, too, is a significant opportunity. About half of Xilinx's current auto revenue (around 3% to 4% of total revenue) comes from ADAS, where Xilinx is the #2 supplier today, and where expectations are for exceptional content growth over the next 10 years as cars incorporate more safety and assistance features on the path to partial or fully autonomous driving. This is perhaps one of the most uncertain markets for Xilinx, as there are so many chip companies throwing their hats into this rink (including Nvidia, Intel, and Renesas (OTCPK:RNECY) among others).",NVDA

82,Elizabeth Gurdus,Cramer: Here are 7 shutdown-proof investing themes,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/24/cramer-here-are-7-shutdown-proof-investing-themes.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"This earnings season is far enough along that investors can start making judgments about which stock market sectors are on the rise and which ones could see weakness in the better part of 2019, says CNBC's Jim Cramer. ""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

Target's last five years have not been pretty, and its future in large part depends on growth of its e-commerce platform. Target is making progress, and I think it is worth a measured bet. The Making Money While I Sleep Portfolio's January buys are in. Owners of Target (TGT) stock have taken a beating as the merchandiser’s shares have been whacked to the tune nearly 20% since mid November.Ouch.Shares first started to fall in early November, but things really got going when the retailer released its 11/20 earnings report which was… ummm… not well received. Shares fell 7% on the back of the report and have traded sideways since.Target is a blue chip company with a fantastic track record. When a stock like that takes a whack, it behooves investors to do some analysis. Is this company on sale, or is it stock on the receiving end of a well deserved valuation adjustment?Keeping an eye on beaten up blue chips has served me well, helping me get into Starbucks at a fantastic price. The trick, however, is to avoid the falling knife.I’ll give you the short version: if you think Target is going to start growing, you should buy here. If not, stay away.Valuation and GrowthTarget trades at a PE ratio of 11.7. On the surface, this is an attractive number, but a key piece of any valuation is the company’s expected future growth. It would seem Mr. Market is not impressed by Target’s growth prospects.Is this fair?Well… yeah, if history is any guide. Target has spent the last five years providing shareholders with exactly what it is priced for: no meaningful growth in sales or earnings.Revenue has been stagnant at a little over $70 billion since 2013, and the lack of growth holds down to the bottom line. Just check out the two graphs from Target’s 2017 annual report. Notice anything? And don’t bother looking too hard.In fact, if I notice anything, it’s the uncomfortable feeling I get in my stomach from eyeing these charts. The trend line is flat, the 5-year CAGR is negative, and none of these things make me feel happy thoughts as a potential investor.That is why Target trades at a depressed valuation multiple.The question becomes whether the multiple has been punished enough, and, more importantly, whether the company will be able to get the “E” portion moving in coming years. I’m not interested in holding a growthless company for the long run, no matter how good the dividend or how low the PE ratio. If Target can return to growth, the market will sort out the rest.A lot has been written of Target’s attempts to rejuvenate brands and improve the in store experience, and I’m not going to dig into that here. The elephant in the room is the online retail space. Target would be just fine in a world without Amazon (AMZN). However, the threat is real, and Target has long been behind in the online weapons race, thousands of miles behind Amazon and well behind comparable retailer Walmart (WMT).E-commerceWhile starting from behind, Target isn’t taking the e-commerce hits lying down. The company is pushing hard to catch up. In fact, in the last quarter, online sales for Target increased 49% year over year.",NVDA

90,Nicholas Ward,My Dividend Growth Investing Wish List | Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235438-dividend-growth-investing-wish-list?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryThe market rally has ruined my year-end watch list.Many stocks that were nearing my price targets are no longer cheap.Now, only a few of the names I was looking at appear to be cheap.It's been a little while since I wrote a focus ticker piece here at Seeking Alpha. The start of the year is always a busy time with work, and I had to take time out to post 2018 recap pieces, as well as Nick's Picks for 2019. Furthermore, I've only made a couple of trades thus far in the new year, buying Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Constellation Brands (STZ) on big down days, but they both recovered so quickly that I didn't have time to write pieces when relevant prices were still available (I've found that this is often the case when high quality names like that are down double digits in a single trading session; those moves are over-reactions that I love to take advantage of. Since I missed out on writing about those two purchases, I wanted to take some time to re-visit my current watch list. I touched on some stocks that I was interested in buying in my year-end interview with SA, but a lot has changed since late December in the markets.At the end of my December portfolio recap, I said that I was looking closely at potentially adding shares of Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA), Cisco (CSCO), Union Pacific (UNP), and the major industrial names, 3M Co. (MMM), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and United Technologies (UTX) to my portfolio.I'm already long all of these names except for UNP, and I viewed them as high quality blue chips that were trading at discounts. This list was on top of the recent purchases of beaten down stocks that I made in December: sin stocks, Altria (MO) and Constellation Brands (STZ), the major logistics firms, FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), and a couple of high yielding semiconductor names, Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).I was looking at all of these names before the Santa Clause rally that we got, sending the market up double digits from its lows. So, now that we've stabilized a bit (in terms of negative volatility), I thought it was a good idea to re-examine that list and see where the best value lies in the DGI market today.AltriaFirst and foremost, I think it makes sense to start with Altria. The stock sold off some 6% today, and I've had a lot of readers reaching out to me about whether or not I'm buying here at the lows. While I do find the value and the dividend yield that Altria offers investors at the moment to be very enticing, I have not added just yet. This is mainly because my Altria position is already overweight after recent purchases, and I want to be careful dipping my toes into the water deeper here. I'd be happy to add more MO shares to my portfolio because I believe the 7%+ dividend is safe. However, I wanted to watch the stock for a couple days on the heels of the recent FDA announcements regarding vaping and Morgan Stanley's big downgrade. However, if I wasn't already so long, I wouldn't be as cautious. I think that Altria is one of the best values in the market (especially the DGI market) today, and here's why.Frankly put, I think too much bad news has already been priced into MO shares. Altria is trading for less than 12x earnings. It wasn't long ago that this stock sported a P/E ratio of more than 23x. To justify the 12x earnings, I think you'd have to say that the 7% yield is in doubt. I'd also have to think that you'd doubt any future growth potential. To me, neither of these things are true.Altria's cash flows cover the dividend by roughly $1b. Tobacco companies are known for high payout ratios, yet Altria's is one of the lowest in the space. Furthermore, even though interest expenses from recent debt raised to make the JUUL (JUUL) and Cronos (OTC:CRON) deals will cut into profits moving, I don't see that $1b surplus evaporating. Morgan Stanley's downgrade was focused on the threat of an uptick in negative cigarette volume growth. It would take a massive drop in volumes to cancel out the cash flow surplus related to the dividend. Falling cigarette sales is certainly an issue for MO (and the tobacco industry as a whole), yet I think the company acknowledges this with its recent moves. I know investors and analysts alike are worried about the valuations that MO paid for its vaping and marijuana assets, but I'd much rather see this management team (which has been acknowledged as being the smartest guy in the room for decades now) being proactive while they have massive cash flows than waiting until they're all dried up to attempt to evolve the company.",NVDA

Swan said Intel's modem business grew by 60 percent over last year but still came in about $200 million below target. The modem unit had ""fantastic growth, but weaker than we expected, and as a result that impacted our revenues for the quarter,"" Swan said. Intel forecast first-quarter revenue of $16 billion and adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $17.35 billion and a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ""The macro environment does not look good at the moment and if it gets worse, Intel could see a further downside to its outlook,"" said Kinngai Chan, an analyst with Summit Insights Group. Intel's search for a permanent CEO has lasted six months. Last June, then-CEO Brian Krzanich resigned after a probe of a relationship with another Intel employee. ""I am convinced the board will close on a new CEO in the near future, and I believe the management team, myself and the 107,000 employees will rally behind him or her to take this company as a whole new level,"" Swan said on a conference call with investors. ""In the meantime, we will not be distracted by the void."" Fourth-quarter revenue in the higher-margin data center business came in at $6.07 billion, below expectations of $6.35 billion, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet. Revenue in the client computing business, which includes sales to PC makers was $9.82 billion, missing FactSet estimates of $10.01 billion. Intel reported https://bit.ly/2FN4ac0 net income of $5.20 billion, or $1.12 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 29, compared with a loss of $687 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $18.66 billion from $17.05 billion, but missed estimates of $19.01 billion. Excluding items, the company earned $1.28 per share, above expectations of $1.22.

""We need to be on the lookout for themes that are working in spite of the litany of big-picture negatives"" including the turmoil in Washington, slowingglobal economic growth and the damage done by the Federal Reserve's ""ill-advised"" statements about interest rates in late 2018, Cramer, the host of ""Mad Money,"" told investors Thursday. Here are seven themes that he thinks can inspire some strategic (and successful) investing: ""If your company's involved with aerospace, there's a good chance that you'll report a monster upside surprise,"" Cramer said, citing a recent earnings report from industrial giant United Technologies, which saw 22 percent organic year-over-year growth in its aerospace division. That told Cramer that ""the aerospace industry has accelerated dramatically,"" he said. ""Now, there are still some worries about China. I get that. But the demand flow is so strong that China may not even matter that much."" That should benefit General Electric, Honeywell and Boeing, all of which specialize in segments of aerospace, Cramer said. Even so, he said United Technologies was his favorite ""because of the disruptive new aircraft engine."" Still, ""the whole group is too low,"" he said. ""That even includes GE, although the story there is a lot more messy thanks to the problems from long-term care insurance and the ailing power division. But Honeywell? Honeywell's just a buy."" 5G, or the fifth generation of wireless mobile connectivity, ""is starting to make an impact"" as well, the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""There's a reason why Xilinx reported the best quarter of any semiconductor company so far — they have the most to gain from the early adoption of 5G and they already have substantial orders,"" Cramer said adding that Xilinx ""feels like the new Nvidia"" because of its business lines in artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and, importantly, telecommunications. ""[Xilinx] ignited a rally in the semiconductor cohort, aided by Lam Research, and I think the run is for real, even though Intel gave us some downbeat guidance after the close,"" he said. The third major theme is the world's largest biotechnology and pharmaceutical players racing to find the best ways to treat, or even cure, cancer, Cramer said. From Bristol-Myers Squibb's deal to buy Celgene to GlaxoSmithKline's purchase of Tesaro to Eli Lilly's acquisition of Loxo Oncology, most of the recent, high-profile deals in the health-care space center on the disease, he noted. ""Put it all together and I think there are a ton of biotechs that might be worth speculating on here,"" Cramer said. ""Anything with a credible cancer immunotherapy pipeline could be in play."" The ongoing trend of companies moving their operations to digital formats, particularly the cloud, isn't stopping anytime soon, either, Cramer said. ""That's the message we got from IBM, for instance, which is doing some very powerful work in health care,"" he said. ""When you think digitization, I urge you to think of companies like VMware ... and Cisco,"" which build infrastructure for the cloud. Cramer had a slightly different take on these two groups: ""Anything related to housing or autos should be avoided ... like the plague."" ""These are no-growth industries globally and there's nothing good happening here unless we have a great spring selling season,"" he said. ""I think the estimates need to come down for pretty much any company in either cohort, from 3M ... to Toll [Brothers] to Masco and to Lowe's."" After seeing the destruction in parts of the retail sector this holiday season, Cramer has concluded that when it comes to retail, ""only a couple"" stocks are really working. He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said. ""Remember them the next time everything goes crazy and, given the circumstances, you won't have all that long to wait.""

Wall Street largely believes the company's sales shortfall is an Intel-specific problem and they remain bullish on the semiconductor industry as a whole.

Jefferies noted that Intel is getting attacked on all sides, including by Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. Some analysts like J.P. Morgan lowered their price targets, while Susquehanna went further saying, ""In short, we are downgrading shares of Intel to neutral on DCG (datacenter group) deceleration, building competitive risks, narrowing process technology leadership, macro concerns, and what we believe is now fair value for a company potentially struggling to grow earnings in 2019.

Analysts worried about rising competition in the semiconductor space in notes after Thursday's report. The analysts remained bullish on the sector overall, which had one of its best days in a decade prior to Intel's report Thursday. Intel posted revenue of $18.66 billion compared with the $19.01 billion analysts were expecting, according to Refinitiv. The company beat on earnings, reporting $1.28 per share, excluding certain items, compared with $1.22 per share expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv. Intel also provided light guidance, saying it expects to post 87 cents in earnings per share in the next quarter, excluding certain items, on around $16 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2019. Analysts had expected $1.01 per share, excluding certain items, on $17.35 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv. Intel's search for a new chief executive is still ongoing, the company told investors Thursday. The company has been without a permanent CEO for seven months, since Brian Krzanich was forced out after Intel determined he had been in a ""consensual relationship with an Intel employee."" In the meantime, Intel's finance chief, Bob Swan, has been serving as interim CEO. On Thursday's call with investors, Swan said Intel's board is ""proceeding with a sense of urgency while also ensuring that they make the right choice for this great company."" Jefferies gave Intel an underperform rating, saying, ""We are bullish on semis in part because consolidation is driving pricing power and higher margins, but we think the opposite will happen to Intel over the next 12-to-24 months.""

He recommended the stocks of Walmart, Costco, Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Five Below, Ollie's Bargain Outlet, Burlington, Ross Stores and TJX Companies, hitting his famous ""sell"" button for ""everyone else"" in the space. Consumer spending in China can also lead to gains for certain companies with business lines there, especially versus expectations that trade tensions will lead to boycotts of U.S. goods by Chinese consumers, Cramer said. ""There's been a resurgence in Procter &amp; Gamble,"" he noted. ""This strength defies the broader consumer packaged goods industry and it's led by spending in China. So don't write off every American company that that's doing a ton of business in the People's Republic — think Nike or Starbucks, which, frankly, just reported a pretty robust quarter."" ""Regardless of what happens with the trade talks or the government shutdown, these seven themes can guide you through this tumultuous environment,"" Cramer said.

107,"Stephen Simpson, CFA","Xilinx Emerges As A Semiconductor Unicorn And Shivs The Shorts - Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) | Seeking Alpha",https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235602-xilinx-emerges-semiconductor-unicorn-shivs-shorts?source=cnbc,https://seekingalpha.com/,"SummaryXilinx zigs while the rest of the semiconductor zags, as 5G, broadcast, data center, and aero/defense drive 34% yoy revenue growth, a strong beat versus expectations, and an upward revision.Xilinx is looking at significant opportunities across its end-markets, including 5G, ADAS/autonomous driving, machine vision/factory automation, and AI inference.With the big post-earnings spike, Xilinx shares look basically fairly-valued, albeit with exceptional momentum in the business.Not too many semiconductor stocks have reported as of this writing, but with the Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) reports in, it looks like the market's fears of another round of downward guidance revisions for the first quarter are materializing. But then, there's Xilinx (XLNX) - quite possibly a true unicorn this quarter in not only reporting very strong growth (revenue up 34% yoy and 7% qoq) but also guiding UP for the next quarter.With strong earnings and the 5G opportunity seeming to come through sooner than expected, Xilinx shares shot up almost 20% and set a new 52-week high. Xilinx has a legitimate, differentiated opportunity with its strong FPGA and FPGA/SoC portfolio, including near-term opportunities like 5G wireless and auto ADAS and longer-term opportunities like data center/AI and autonomous driving. Although I think Xilinx can generate double-digit long-term revenue growth and that today's DCF-based fair value isn't unreasonable, it's certainly not an overlooked opportunity at this point.Great Numbers For The December QuarterXilinx reported 34% yoy and 7% qoq revenue growth for the December quarter (the company's fiscal third quarter), beating expectations by 4%.Although the company saw weaker demand from industrial customers and only flat sales to the auto sector, it hardly mattered. Communications revenue jumped 41% as the company is seeing broadening 5G deployments beyond South Korea (Texas Instruments management said they believe North American deployments have begun). Industrial, Aero, &amp; Defense revenue rose 18% as stronger aerospace and defense demand counterbalanced weakness in factory automation and industrial IoT (hardly a surprise, given recent comments from Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) and Nidec (OTCPK:NJDCY)). Datacenter and TME revenue was up 14%, which bodes well for Agilent (A), and revenue in the Broadcast, Consumer, and Auto market was up 20% on strength in broadcast.A mix shift toward communications has implications for margins, and gross margin declined 130bp year over year (flat sequentially), which was in line with expectations (arguably a beat, in effect, the unexpectedly high level of Communications revenue). Operating income rose 61% yoy and 11% qoq, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding by 550bp yoy (and 120bp qoq), helping drive a bottom-line beat.Better still, management gave strong guidance for the March quarter. Calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the next quarter, Xilinx set a target about 6% above the prior average sell-side estimate.Plenty Of Room To RunWith the 5G ramp just beginning, Xilinx is in the early days of a market opportunity that could see its served addressable market grow by more than $2 billion over the next four years (to over $7 billion), with more FPGAs going into both radios and baseband. If there's a ""but"", it is likely concern that deployments could take longer than expected (which I don't consider probable) and/or that ASICs will eventually spoil the party. That has been the basic history of FPGAs - great growth eventually disrupted by the eventual introduction of lower-priced ASICs. Although that will probably happen here too, it will take a while.And 5G isn't the only thing Xilinx has going for it. The data center business is only about 5% of revenue now, even though Xilinx scored some early wins with Amazon (AMZN) (while Microsoft (MSFT) has gone with Intel/Altera). Xilinx has seen multiple hyperscale wins for its Smart NICs, though, and the new Alveo and ""AI Core"" chips should make Xilinx a legitimate competitor alongside Nvidia (NVDA) in AI inference - a market currently served mostly by Intel Xeon chips, but that could be worth over $6 billion in 2025 (according to SIG analyst Christopher Rolland) and where I/O fabric, cache size, and programmability are key factors (and where the single-chip ASPs are startlingly high).Auto, too, is a significant opportunity. About half of Xilinx's current auto revenue (around 3% to 4% of total revenue) comes from ADAS, where Xilinx is the #2 supplier today, and where expectations are for exceptional content growth over the next 10 years as cars incorporate more safety and assistance features on the path to partial or fully autonomous driving. This is perhaps one of the most uncertain markets for Xilinx, as there are so many chip companies throwing their hats into this rink (including Nvidia, Intel, and Renesas (OTCPK:RNECY) among others).",NVDA

Jefferies noted that Intel is getting attacked on all sides, including by Nvidia in the data center market and AMD in PCs. Some analysts like J.P. Morgan lowered their price targets, while Susquehanna went further saying, ""In short, we are downgrading shares of Intel to neutral on DCG (datacenter group) deceleration, building competitive risks, narrowing process technology leadership, macro concerns, and what we believe is now fair value for a company potentially struggling to grow earnings in 2019.

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

""We're going to keep watching this, but right now, it's not on the road map,"" Johnson said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" Johnson said that the company is going to keep focusing on its other innovations, like its Nitro Cold Brew. The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members. For customers not interested in the loyalty program, Starbucks has been building an email list — now 13 million strong — to promote its products and deals.",SBUX

I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something ""for free,"" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free — all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

Western Digital– The semiconductor stock jumped 7.5 percent. Western Digital's earnings were below expectations yet investors welcomed the company's efforts to cut costs. Ford Motor – The automaker's shares rose 3 percent after CEO Jim Hackett sent an email to employees that last year's ""mediocre"" results were unacceptable. Hackett said Ford aims to nearly double its annual operating profit, although he did not specify when that would happen.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq on track to eke out gains for the shortened holiday week. But the S&amp;P 500 looked set to show its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. President Donald Trump said he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. This helped boost investor sentiment, which faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. ""Obviously the risk is on today,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. ""There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with resolving the government shutdown."" ""But I find it difficult to have much conviction in this market on an upswing when there's so much uncertainty both politically and economically about where this country is headed,"" Baumohl added. Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China remains an overhang. With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are ""fed up"" with President Donald Trump's policies. An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide.

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq eking out their fifth straight weekly gains. But the S&amp;P 500 posted its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. The indexes backed off their highs after President Donald Trump confirmed he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. Investor sentiment had faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. ""As some of these uncertainties in the market start to diminish we'll get a clearer picture as to where things are headed,"" said Charlie Ripley, senior market strategist for Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. ""And today's news of the ending of the government shutdown certainly alleviates some of that overhang."" ""But most likely some uncertainty will linger as this is only a temporary measure to fund the government for now,"" Ripley added.

All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales – or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good – I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if – why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that. And right now that's not on the road map. But you know, we are mindful of the trends, we're mindful of how -- I'll say CBD oils and CBD is viewed as a health and wellness. And so, you know, we're going to keep watching this. But right now, not on the road map. CARL QUINTANILLA: You need to go work for Starbucks R&amp;D, Jim. JIM CRAMER: Believe me, I'm ready to don a green apron in a flash. Because you can get benefits like no other company. Congratulations. And by the way, these guys hire veterans like there is no tomorrow and they deserve it if everybody else did this, then every veteran would have a job. That's what they do. What do you say, David? DAVID FABER: We still have Kevin with us or are we wrapping him up? JIM CRAMER: No, he's right there. DAVID FABER: I'm not hearing what -- whether we got time. Kevin, I'm curious about this line of questioning that Jim opened up about AI and what you're learning or how you're doing it. Can you give us more sense as to how that works or what that meant on the ground during the Christmas season for, for example, in terms of your ability to fulfill customers and a more effective way? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, I'll frame it sort of, David, around customer insights. And coming out of last year's holiday, we used a number of tools and research to give us customer insights on what customers really appreciated and loved about Starbucks at the holiday. And that informed everything from the design of our cups to the, you know, utilizing the re-useable red cup promotion that we launched. You know, we saw gift card sales grow 4% year on year on the quarter. That was a function of customer insight and research that we did. So this holiday, in many ways, was informed by that insight. And that's an example of what we are doing. We're using all kinds of data, customer focus groups and things to help us be more informed, more front footed on the trends and the things that customers really want to see from Starbucks. JIM CRAMER: Okay. Well, Kevin what the customers may want to see in China is a cup that is not an American cup, because people are worried about tension in the same way that Xiaomi has been able to take share from Apple – what are you drinking? You've got a Starbucks? You don't even have a cup – a label on there. Can you hold that cup up? Does it say Starbucks on it? Alright, so -- KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, this is a – Jim, we're in the Roastery. We have a Starbucks Reserve right here. JIM CRAMER: Kevin, this Luckin, they've put up 600 stores in seven months, they're coming in 20 to 30% under you. Why wouldn't I want to go to Luckin over Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, first of all, you know, when you look at a competitor like Luckin, they talk about the number of units that they're growing. And I think sometimes a unit would look perhaps like a Starbucks store, but most of the times they look like a point of presence. And so, you know, you need to visit these for yourself. That said, you know, having a lot of points of presence, we're at 370 stores, we have our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle coming in, with food services and CPG. The reason you want to come to Starbucks is because we create that unique customer experience, we serve the world's finest Arabica coffee. Our partners will hand craft beverage to your perfection, and we create an experience like no other in the industry. And we're going to continue to stay true to the experience we create in our stores and how we extend that experience with the digital mobile relationship. The China digital partnership with Alibaba is making great progress. We now have the virtual Starbucks store integrated into the Alibaba properties. That's now reaching 600 million Chinese who use Alibaba on a daily basis. And so, you know, we think the strategy that we're on is the right one, it is allowing us now to continue to grow transactions in the double digits. And we're going to continue to play the long game with the strategy that made Starbucks what it is today in China. JIM CRAMER: Well, thank you so much, Kevin, for coming on, for playing. Because we have tough questions and good questions. This is the best quarter for a couple of years. Great job. That's Kevin Johnson, he's the President and CEO of Starbucks.

A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

""We're going to keep watching this, but right now, it's not on the road map,"" Johnson said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" Johnson said that the company is going to keep focusing on its other innovations, like its Nitro Cold Brew. The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members. For customers not interested in the loyalty program, Starbucks has been building an email list — now 13 million strong — to promote its products and deals.",SBUX

I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something ""for free,"" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free — all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq on track to eke out gains for the shortened holiday week. But the S&amp;P 500 looked set to show its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. President Donald Trump said he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. This helped boost investor sentiment, which faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. ""Obviously the risk is on today,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. ""There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with resolving the government shutdown."" ""But I find it difficult to have much conviction in this market on an upswing when there's so much uncertainty both politically and economically about where this country is headed,"" Baumohl added. Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China remains an overhang. With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are ""fed up"" with President Donald Trump's policies. An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide. Fourth-quarter corporate earnings season is in high gear, with more than 22 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 72.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations. Earnings on Friday were a mixed bag. Starbucks Corp also surpassed Street consensus, reporting better-than-anticipated quarterly sales. The coffee chain's shares were up 3.1 percent. Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive Co reported fourth-quarter revenue that surprised to the upside but said it expects profit to decline in 2019. Its stock edged down 0.7 percent. Intel Corp shares dropped 5.7 percent following the chipmaker's disappointing fourth-quarter sales and current-quarter forecasts. Still, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index was up 2.3 percent in the wake of a spate of positive earnings from other chipmakers. DR Horton Inc's quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, underscoring persistent weakness in the U.S. housing market. The homebuilder's shares dropped 4.3 percent. Western Digital Corp also disappointed, but its shares rose 6.9 percent after providing an upbeat forecast and saying it was committed to paying dividends.

All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales – or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good – I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if – why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that. And right now that's not on the road map. But you know, we are mindful of the trends, we're mindful of how -- I'll say CBD oils and CBD is viewed as a health and wellness. And so, you know, we're going to keep watching this. But right now, not on the road map. CARL QUINTANILLA: You need to go work for Starbucks R&amp;D, Jim. JIM CRAMER: Believe me, I'm ready to don a green apron in a flash. Because you can get benefits like no other company. Congratulations. And by the way, these guys hire veterans like there is no tomorrow and they deserve it if everybody else did this, then every veteran would have a job. That's what they do. What do you say, David? DAVID FABER: We still have Kevin with us or are we wrapping him up? JIM CRAMER: No, he's right there. DAVID FABER: I'm not hearing what -- whether we got time. Kevin, I'm curious about this line of questioning that Jim opened up about AI and what you're learning or how you're doing it. Can you give us more sense as to how that works or what that meant on the ground during the Christmas season for, for example, in terms of your ability to fulfill customers and a more effective way? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, I'll frame it sort of, David, around customer insights. And coming out of last year's holiday, we used a number of tools and research to give us customer insights on what customers really appreciated and loved about Starbucks at the holiday. And that informed everything from the design of our cups to the, you know, utilizing the re-useable red cup promotion that we launched. You know, we saw gift card sales grow 4% year on year on the quarter. That was a function of customer insight and research that we did. So this holiday, in many ways, was informed by that insight. And that's an example of what we are doing. We're using all kinds of data, customer focus groups and things to help us be more informed, more front footed on the trends and the things that customers really want to see from Starbucks. JIM CRAMER: Okay. Well, Kevin what the customers may want to see in China is a cup that is not an American cup, because people are worried about tension in the same way that Xiaomi has been able to take share from Apple – what are you drinking? You've got a Starbucks? You don't even have a cup – a label on there. Can you hold that cup up? Does it say Starbucks on it? Alright, so -- KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, this is a – Jim, we're in the Roastery. We have a Starbucks Reserve right here. JIM CRAMER: Kevin, this Luckin, they've put up 600 stores in seven months, they're coming in 20 to 30% under you. Why wouldn't I want to go to Luckin over Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, first of all, you know, when you look at a competitor like Luckin, they talk about the number of units that they're growing. And I think sometimes a unit would look perhaps like a Starbucks store, but most of the times they look like a point of presence. And so, you know, you need to visit these for yourself. That said, you know, having a lot of points of presence, we're at 370 stores, we have our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle coming in, with food services and CPG. The reason you want to come to Starbucks is because we create that unique customer experience, we serve the world's finest Arabica coffee. Our partners will hand craft beverage to your perfection, and we create an experience like no other in the industry. And we're going to continue to stay true to the experience we create in our stores and how we extend that experience with the digital mobile relationship. The China digital partnership with Alibaba is making great progress. We now have the virtual Starbucks store integrated into the Alibaba properties. That's now reaching 600 million Chinese who use Alibaba on a daily basis. And so, you know, we think the strategy that we're on is the right one, it is allowing us now to continue to grow transactions in the double digits. And we're going to continue to play the long game with the strategy that made Starbucks what it is today in China. JIM CRAMER: Well, thank you so much, Kevin, for coming on, for playing. Because we have tough questions and good questions. This is the best quarter for a couple of years. Great job. That's Kevin Johnson, he's the President and CEO of Starbucks.

The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/01/25/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-starbucks-ceo-on-q4-earnings-report.html. All references must be sourced to CNBC. JIM CRAMER: Alright, we have a treat here. Shares of Starbucks are out this morning. As they should, the coffee giant reporting better than expected first quarter earnings. There were strong U.S. comps, and there's continued growth in China, although, I would say we need to ask more about it. So joining us now, FIRST ON CNBC, Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson. Kevin, how have you been? KEVIN JOHNSON: I'm well. Happy New Year, guys. I haven't seen you in a while. JIM CRAMER: Too long. It's been too long. Last time at the Rose Stream. We'll do Rose Stream maybe in Milan. I love that one. Okay, let's get right to it. This was the first quarter upside on strongest comps since June of 2017. The comeback is here. How have you done it? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, clearly, Jim, the streamline activities that we embarked on six quarters ago are paying off. It's allowing us to have more focus and discipline against our three strategic priorities. You know, we're focused on accelerating our growth in the U.S. and China, and that's working. We're now leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestle to expand the reach of Starbucks globally. And we're continuing to focus on shareholder value, creation and we have returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders over the past two years. But this last quarter was just another demonstration that our strategy is working. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, one of the things that you didn't get to talk enough about on the call, which I was surprised someone didn't ask, is the Uber Delivery. Apparently the Miami test is doing great. You're brewing out in a lot of places. And it's a big win for you. Is it moving comp stores sales – or do you see it moving comp stores sales in Miami? And will it move comp store sales when you roll it out across the nation? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well certainly what we're doing, Jim, is we're enabling a new channel for customers to engage with Starbucks with Starbucks Delivers. And as you know, in China, we partnered with Alibaba and their delivery company Ele.me to enable it in China. It is going very well in China. And in the U.S., we've partnered with Uber Eats. And we started in Miami. We saw good customer demand and incrementally. We now have rolled it out in San Francisco. And we have a plan now to bring it to a significant number of stores across the U.S. here over the next 90 days. And so we're optimistic that delivery is going to be another one of those things that will boost our traffic and continue to give customers an opportunity to engage with Starbucks in a new way. JIM CRAMER: Alright Kevin, we've got to ask you this. We talked about it -- I know you watch the show -- so you're already prepped for it. 2% decline in comp transactional in China. 1% growth versus what we used to do eight. You seemed almost content with that, Kevin. And I was surprised at that, given the fact that's a deceleration and given the fact I would have thought this quarter, it would have done better. So please tell us why you're okay with that de-sell and tell us what you're going to do to fix it? KEVIN JOHNSON: First of all, Jim, the number one metric we look at in China is total transaction growth. And those total transactions come from a combination of new stores that we build, as well as same store comp. And if you look at the fact that we opened -- we increased the number of new stores by -- increased the number of stores in China by 18% this quarter, and so if you put all of that together, we had transaction growth -- double digit transaction growth in China. And china is a market that is all about first mover advantage. It's about building new stores and expanding our presence. In fact, we're now approaching 3700 stores in China. We entered ten new cities last quarter. We're in 158 cities in China. The addressable market and the growth opportunity in China is significant. So the priority we have is really expanding our footprint, while we continue to enhance the experience in our stores, drive beverage innovation and enable new channels for customers to engage with Starbucks like Starbucks Delivers. So we are playing the long game in China. DAVID FABER: Yeah, Kevin, thanks. It's David. And you know, those numbers, I think people just should stop for a moment: 3700 stores, 158 cities. But that said, given its importance overall to your long game, and to the growth of the company, when you talk about the market being highly promotional and disruptive, give us a sense as to what that means and whether that is just going to be the landscape for the long game you're talking about. KEVIN JOHNSON: Yeah, David. So context: whenever you have a large addressable market, around coffee in China, you're going to have a lot of competitors come in. Now some of those competitors are going to try to differentiate in different ways. And so they're going to have to use price and be highly promotional in what they do. For Starbucks, we differentiate on the in-store experience, we differentiate on the quality of our coffee, and we differentiate on the digital reach that we have through our partnership with Alibaba. Now the one thing that the competition is certainly doing in China is it is expanding the addressable market for coffee. It's introducing the Chinese consumer, who is primarily a tea drinking culture, to coffee. And so that's helpful for the growth and the addressable market. For Starbucks, we're confident. We're going to play our game. We know how to create the kind of experience and leverage the brand strength that we have in China to create -- to create that unique differentiated opportunity for us to engage in customers. And so I think if you look at the overall landscape of who is growing the most share of transactions and engagement with the customer, I think Starbucks comes out on top. CARL QUINTANILLA: Kevin, the guys-- we discussed the Uber Eats partnership earlier in the week. And I got to thinking, you know, delivery of coffee is so much about speed and having a cup of coffee that is hot. Are there structural challenges in delivering coffee in an Uber? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, you know, this is why we partnered with Uber Eats. Dara and the Uber team put a lot of emphasis on Uber Eats and Delivery to the point where we work together to integrate our software, so that our mobile app can integrate directly into their software to dispatch and their app interfaces directly into our store operations. So we made it seamless for partners in our stores to get those orders and then embraced some of the best practices candidly that were created in Starbucks China when we launched delivery. So when we prepare a beverage for delivery, we prepare it as a hotter temperature than we would normally in the store so that when that beverage is delivered and handed to the customer, ideally it is at the same temperature that it would have been when they picked it up in our stores. So we've prioritized the customer experience around delivery and fully integrated the operational processes from Uber Eats into our Starbucks stores. And that's part of the key to making this a great, great customer experience. JIM CRAMER: Well, Kevin, I love you, but I would have to wait 19 minutes for my coffee in China. Kevin, I don't care if you put that thing -- you bake it in hell. I just do not think after 19 minutes that thing is going to come out piping hot. KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, we're happy to host you in our stores. We've got 3700 in china and we're approaching 30,000 around the world. You're welcome anytime. JIM CRAMER: Fair enough. Now listen, Kevin, you're from tech. You're from Juniper. You were a great tech guy. I detected artificial intelligence about you trying to figure out what people want. It is the first time I've heard it. It is almost as if you finally figured out, you cracked the code about what people want, whether it be Nitro, the more expensive drinks. Are you using machine learning and artificial intelligence to figure out what the customers want for first time at Starbucks? KEVIN JOHNSON: Jim, we have dramatically stepped up the focus on customer insight and we are using technology to help inform us of what customers want, what they need, and what they think of Starbucks. That informed our entire holiday plan this year and we had a fantastic holiday. And so we are driving much more use of analytics, artificial intelligence, personalization, and technology to help us be more informed and more connected to our customers and that is making us a better company. JIM CRAMER: Alright, Kevin, you know, I like to bring something to the party when I get together with you. I have been working some of these companies like Canopy Growth. Alright. Now you know that is a cannabis company. In this country we will be drinking cannabis coffee and cannabis tea. I would rather be able to have a triple venti cannabis venti -- whatever at your place than I would the other guy. You know that other guys, your competitors, are going to be having cannabis tea and coffee. Are you going to be, in the states that it is legal: Washington, California, Oregon -- can I get a cannabis triple venti? KEVIN JOHNSON: You know, Jim, you can't get it today. We're well aware of what is happening around CBD, THC and all the trends in the industry. But you know, we're staying focused on the beverage innovation that we're driving and right now it is all about Nitro. You know, we talked yesterday about how we're deploying Nitro and Nitro Cold Brew across our entire portfolio of company-operated stores. But, you know, we will always stay on top of consumer trends and new ideas. And so I always appreciate your suggestions. JIM CRAMER: Well let me press that again, because you know I love the Nitro, it really makes you feel good – I think it's a fantastic drink -- but the cannabis, if you did a little, lets say, Indica, it would be a nice way to get down from the one I finished with the Nitro. In other words, if – why not sample it in California, Kevin? Why not just take it by storm? KEVIN JOHNSON: Well, Jim, I think there is a lot of issues that we have to think through on that.

26,Shreyashi   Sanyal,US STOCKS-Earnings optimism pushes Wall Street higher,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/reuters-america-us-stocks-earnings-optimism-pushes-wall-street-higher.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"(For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click or type LIVE/ in a news window.) * Starbucks, Western Digital rise after results * Senate in search for remedies to end government shutdown * Intel drops as China slowdown hits earnings, forecast * Indexes up: Dow 0.76 pct, S&amp;P 0.66 pct, Nasdaq 0.72 pct (Updates to open) Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday, with technology and consumer discretionary sectors leading a rally, as upbeat earnings reports helped investors overlook trade and growth worries. A strong rally at start of the year was stalled this week by concerns about global economic growth, U.S. government shutdown and U.S.-China trade talks. But with fourth-quarter earnings largely exceeding Wall Street expectations, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 is holding near six-week highs. News that the U.S. Senate was looking for a way to end a partial U.S. government shutdown, entering its 35th day, also added to the mood. Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities said in a client note that renewed talks to end government shutdown and earnings ""that for the most part are beating expectations"" were helping the markets. The consumer discretionary sector rose 1.27 percent, boosted by gains in Starbucks Corp and Amazon.com Inc. Starbucks Corp shares rose 4.17 percent as the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States helped quarterly sales top analysts' expectations. The S&amp;P technology sector rose 0.54 percent, lifted by gains in shares of Western Digital Corp and Apple Inc. Western Digital Corp, which missed estimates for quarterly results due to weak demand for its data storage devices, rose 7.60 percent after the company said its revenue would improve in the second half of the year. Shares of rival Seagate Technology climbed 7.59 percent. Three-fourth of the 97 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results have surpassed profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data. That is above the historical average of 64 percent. Semiconductor stocks, which have taken a beating after Apple Inc's sales warnings, led Wall Street's rally on Thursday on better-than-feared results from chipmakers, including Xilinx Inc and Lam Research Corp. However, Intel Corp's dismal current-quarter forecast, which it blamed on a slowdown in China and sluggish demand for its data center and modem chips, sent its shares down 7.72 percent. Intel also capped gains in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which climbed 0.50 percent, after a near 6 percent surge on Thursday. At 9:56 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 187.57 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,740.81, the S&amp;P 500 was up 17.50 points, or 0.66 percent, at 2,659.83 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 51.15 points, or 0.72 percent, at 7,124.61. Investors are bracing for an event-packed week ahead, which includes the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting this year, U.S. jobs data, another round of trade talks and reports from tech giants, including Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Shares of Apple rose 2.10 percent and Amazon climbed 1.35 percent. D.R. Horton Inc, which missed quarterly profit estimates, rose 1.62 percent after the homebuilder said it expected demand to rise during spring season. PHLX housing index climbed 1.65 percent. Colgate-Palmolive Co dropped 0.84 percent after the toothpaste maker forecast a decline in 2019 earnings as it spent more on advertising, while battling higher commodity costs. The healthcare sector dipped 0.09 percent, pulled down by AbbVie Inc which fell 6.96 percent after posting quarterly profit below estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.82-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.28-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&amp;P index recorded seven new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 19 new highs and eight new lows.

27,Amelia Lucas,Starbucks CEO: Cannabis-infused drinks 'not on the road map' right now,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/starbucks-ceo-cannabis-infused-drinks-not-on-the-road-map-right-now.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"Coffee shops up and down the U.S. coasts are advertising lattes with CBD oil, but Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that the coffee giant isn't planning on introducing its own version of the cannabis-infused drink. ""We're going to keep watching this, but right now, it's not on the road map,"" Johnson said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" Johnson said that the company is going to keep focusing on its other innovations, like its Nitro Cold Brew. The company credited its iced beverages, including its nitro drinks, with boosting sales for the quarter that ended Dec. 30. The company released its first-quarter results Thursday, reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings growth. The coffee giant posted same-store sales growth of 4 percent, topping Refinitiv estimates of 2.8 percent. Same-store sales growth in its two largest markets, the U.S. and China/Asia Pacific, also outpaced expectations. Starbucks avoided a repeat of 2017's disappointing holiday sales by using analytics, artificial intelligence and consumer focus groups to better understand what customers want, Johnson said. This time around, it offered fewer limited-time drinks at lower prices. The line-up included six returning seasonal favorites, including the Peppermint Mocha and Gingerbread Latte. The company earned 68 cents per share after removing a 7-cent gain from income tax items. Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 65 cents per share. Revenue 9 percent to $6.63 billion, also topping estimates. Shares of Starbucks, which has an $80.3 billion market value, rose nearly 4 percent Friday morning. Johnson assumed the role of chief executive in April 2017, taking the reins from longtime CEO Howard Schultz. Under Johnson, a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks, the company has focused heavily on its digital presence. Most recently, the company announced its expansion of a delivery pilot with UberEats to six more U.S. cities beyond its original test in Miami. The company has been driving sales by adding more rewards members, with the number reaching 16 million active members. For customers not interested in the loyalty program, Starbucks has been building an email list — now 13 million strong — to promote its products and deals.",SBUX
28,Emmie Martin,"Where to get the best free food, make-up and services on your birthday",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/where-to-get-free-food-make-up-and-services-on-your-birthday.html,https://www.cnbc.com/,"I've never considered myself a birthday person. I don't like being the center of attention and usually let the day pass without much fanfare. But there are few things I love more than the thrill of free food. To celebrate my birthday this past August, then, I set out to rack up as many freebies as possible. Especially tasty ones. In order to maximize my success rate, I knew I had to plan ahead. Six weeks out from the big day, I surveyed which loyalty programs I was already subscribed to and signed up for a host of new ones. As my birthday drew nearer and rewards emails started to roll in, I began drawing up a plan for how many places I could visit. Luckily, several places, including Jamba Juice and Sephora, offered deals that could be redeemed the same week or month as my birthday, so I was able to space everything out. From my original list of 25 restaurants and retailers that reportedly offer birthday perks, seven didn't end up sending a birthday coupon and one I didn't have time to visit. But I packed 17 others into an eventful week, and I visited 10 establishments on my actual birthday alone. As I went, I kept track of everything I got for free or at a discount, recording the New York City prices and values as accurately as possible, depending on how each place handled the transaction. In total, I collected a whopping $111.18 worth of free stuff. Here's everything I got, from lowest to highest dollar value. Item: Small chocolate ice cream with M&amp;MsValue: $1.40My rating: 1/5 stars I signed up for Cold Stone's loyalty program online, which promises a buy-one-get-one coupon on your birthday. Although I created my account well ahead of my birthday month, the coupon never arrived in my inbox. Undeterred, I went to the store anyway to see if they were able to look up my account. When I explained the situation, the employee said she'd go ahead and give me a birthday deal. I ended up paying $5.99 for my chocolate ice cream with M&amp;Ms, but she knocked 20 percent off, saving me around $1.40. Item: Regular watermelon Italian iceValue: $1.84My rating: 4/5 stars I signed up for Rita's Birthday Club online and received an email for a free regular Italian Ice, which expired seven days after the offer arrived. Because Rita's is a seasonal treat, they allow those with birthdays in the winter collect their free ice on their half-birthday. I enjoyed my watermelon ice a few days after my birthday while visiting the Jersey Shore with friends. Items: Two glazed chocolate donutsValue: $2My rating: 2/5 stars Users of Dunkin's rewards app are eligible for a free treat on their birthday. The catch: You have to add money to the app's balance before you can score any deals. Because I'm not a coffee drinker, I didn't want to spend money just to get something ""for free,"" so I downloaded the app but didn't add any cash to it. Although I technically hadn't earned the reward yet, I decided to stop by Dunkin' to see if they'd be willing to give me a perk anyway. A kind employee explained that she couldn't treat me to any free drinks, but she offered me a donut on the house. Even better: She slipped me not one but two glazed chocolate donuts.  Item: Small cone of mint chocolate chipValue: $2.60My rating: 4/5 stars Baskin Robbins' Birthday Club gets you a free kids' size cone or cup on your birthday. But being nice goes a long way: The employee on duty gave me a wink when she took my order and handed me a small scoop of mint chocolate chip instead of a kid's size. Item: Small vanilla milkshakeValue: $2.99My rating: 4/5 stars Arby's birthday perk was the simplest to redeem. I walked in, told the manager it was my birthday and received a small vanilla milkshake, free of charge. The process was seamless and the result was the perfect way to cool down on a scorching August day. Items: One chocolate glazed donut and one plain glazed donutValue: $3.18My rating: 4/5 stars To access Krispy Kreme's birthday rewards, you have to download their app and sign up for their loyalty program there. When I did this I was able to take advantage of two deals: A free birthday donut and a free introductory donut for first time users. If you're counting, yes, I did end up with four donuts in one day. No complaints here. Item: One brownieValue: $3.26My rating: 4/5 stars I've been a member of Panera Bread's MyPanera Rewards program since 2014, so I knew I could expect a freebie on my birthday. The company emailed me a coupon for a free pastry or sweet, valid for one week from my birthday. All of Panera's baked goods were fairly comparable in price, so I chose the item that looked the most indulgent: an iced chocolate fudge brownie. Item: One sprinkle cupcakeValue: $4.25My rating: 3/5 stars Sprinkles Perks members get to enjoy a free cupcake on their big day. I visited a Sprinkles kiosk outside of Penn Station, showed my birthday email and got to choose any cupcake I wanted. To celebrate nearing the end of my birthday freebie extravaganza, I chose a vanilla cupcake covered in actual sprinkles. Item: Vanilla sweet cream cold brewValue: $4.84My rating: 3/5 stars Starbucks is well-known for its rewards app, which offers users any free drink on their birthday. Because there's no price limit, it's a chance for frequent customers to upgrade to a more expensive beverage on their special day. I signed up for Starbucks' rewards program, downloaded the app and added a Starbucks gift card I already had to it. Although the app said I'd earned a free birthday drink, I couldn't click through to it. The barista didn't mind and gave me the drink on the house anyway: venti vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Even though I don't drink coffee, I chose an expensive concoction to test the limits of the birthday reward, then shared the beverage with my coworker. Items: Chocolate muffin and 24-ounce iced strawberry lemonadeValue: $5My rating: 4/5 stars After signing up for Au Bon Pain's online rewards program, the chain emailed me a coupon for a free coffee and pastry during the week of my birthday. The coupon specified that I could choose any bakery item and any size hot coffee or tea, 24-ounce iced beverage or 16-ounce specialty beverage. I gladly stopped by for a chocolate muffin and opted for an iced strawberry lemonade. Item: 12-ounce Apple n' Greens smoothieValue: $6.49My rating: 5/5 stars Because I signed up for Jamba Juice's online rewards program, I received a coupon for a free 12-ounce juice or smoothie, valid for 30 days. Since I knew I had a sugar-filled week ahead of me, I chose a green smoothie option packed with kale and peaches. Items: Two XL slices of New York pizzaValue: $7.98My rating: 4/5 stars Sbarro's Slice Society rewards its members with a free slice of XL New York Pizza or Roman Style Pizza on their birthday, valid for up to two weeks. Since I was new to the Slice Society, I was able to take advantage of their introductory offer: a free slice with the purchase of any beverage. Although I paid around $3 for a Pepsi, I walked away with two hefty slices of pie for free. Items: 'Homewrecker' burrito and chipsValue: $9My rating: 5/5 stars I'd heard that Moe's gives out free burritos for birthdays and I was not disappointed. To get it, I signed up for Moe's Rockin Rewards program and downloaded the app. My birthday perk appeared there and all I had to do at the store was show the app to the cashier in lieu of payment. I also made sure to call ahead, as not every franchise participates in the deal. Moe's ended up being one of the best deals of the day. Between the burrito and accompanying chips, I got a complete and filling meal for free. Items: Four chocolate barsValue: $10My rating: 5/5 stars Godiva's rewards program proved to be one of the best values of the day. The company emailed me a $10 voucher that could be used both in stores or online. I headed to a nearby location and picked up four of their classic bars, which retail for $2.50 each. Item: Rosewater facial sprayValue: $10My rating: 3/5 stars As a benefit of signing up for their mailing list, skincare company Mario Badescu emailed me a promo code worth $10 on my birthday. Although my birthday was in August, it didn't expire until well into September. I used the code right away to order a bottle of the facial spray with aloe, herbs and rosewater, which retails for $7. With shipping and tax, the total came to just over $13, so I still had to pay a few bucks, but overall it was a good deal. Item: Bite Beauty sampler kitValue: $15.35My rating: 4/5 stars Sephora's Beauty Insider program is popular for its annual birthday giveaways, which I've collected for several years now. When I stopped by in 2018, I got a sampler from Bite Beauty, which included a miniature lip crayon, miniature lipstick, lip balm and lip scrub. You can't buy the sample sizes at Sephora, but the kit is currently available from Bite for $15.35 on Amazon. Item: Eyebrow waxValue: $21My rating: 5/5 stars Benefit's free eyebrow wax was hands-down the best value I found all day. I love getting my eyebrows done at the company's brow bars, but costs can add up quickly. For my birthday, the procedure was free — all I had to pay was tip. Like this story?

But other chipmakers held up with AMD shares rising 5.2 percent. Many analysts believe Intel's issues were company specific and noted AMD was gaining market share in PCs and other areas. Western Digital– The semiconductor stock jumped 7.5 percent. Western Digital's earnings were below expectations yet investors welcomed the company's efforts to cut costs. Ford Motor – The automaker's shares rose 3 percent after CEO Jim Hackett sent an email to employees that last year's ""mediocre"" results were unacceptable. Hackett said Ford aims to nearly double its annual operating profit, although he did not specify when that would happen. Vale S.A. – A dam owned by the Brazilian mining company burst on Friday, leading to evacuations. Local emergency personnel in Brazil told AFP that the dam's collapse caused ""several deaths"" due to a mudslide. Vale stock slid 8.1 percent on Friday. Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, United Continental – Airline stocks initially fell following reports of delays at airports across the northeastern U.S. on Friday. The government shutdown is causing a rising shortage of air traffic controllers, which delayed flights to and from New York's LaGuardia, Newark Liberty International and Philadelphia International Airport. Shares of the airlines ended the day positive. Starbucks – The coffee giant's shares gained as the company reported strong sales and earnings growth for its first quarter report. Starbucks saw revenue climb 9 percent year-over-year. Starbucks shares rose 3.6 percent. ResMed – The medical equipment company stock dropped 19.4 percent after reporting shaky second quarter results, with revenue coming in below Wall Street estimates. ResMed announced a temporary suspension of share buybacks, saying the company needs more cash on hand for acquisitions. Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan each downgraded ResMed shares to ratings of neutral and underweight, respectively. WATCH:Ford is using bionic suits to help employees work safer ",SBUX

All three major U.S. stock indexes advanced, with the Dow and the Nasdaq on track to eke out gains for the shortened holiday week. But the S&amp;P 500 looked set to show its first weekly loss of the year, snapping a four-week run. President Donald Trump said he and lawmakers agreed to advance a three-week stop-gap spending plan to reopen the government. This helped boost investor sentiment, which faltered in recent days in the face of revived jitters related to the shutdown and the prolonged U.S.-China tariff spat. ""Obviously the risk is on today,"" said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton. ""There seems to be light at the end of the tunnel with resolving the government shutdown."" ""But I find it difficult to have much conviction in this market on an upswing when there's so much uncertainty both politically and economically about where this country is headed,"" Baumohl added. Among these uncertainties, the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China remains an overhang. With the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland nearing its conclusion, business leaders have expressed worries over the tariff battles, saying they are ""fed up"" with President Donald Trump's policies. An escalation of the U.S.-China trade war would sharpen the global economic slowdown already under way, according to a Reuters poll of hundreds of economists worldwide. Fourth-quarter corporate earnings season is in high gear, with more than 22 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported. Of those, 72.3 percent have beaten analyst expectations. Earnings on Friday were a mixed bag. Starbucks Corp also surpassed Street consensus, reporting better-than-anticipated quarterly sales. The coffee chain's shares were up 3.1 percent. Consumer products company Colgate-Palmolive Co reported fourth-quarter revenue that surprised to the upside but said it expects profit to decline in 2019. Its stock edged down 0.7 percent. Intel Corp shares dropped 5.7 percent following the chipmaker's disappointing fourth-quarter sales and current-quarter forecasts. Still, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index was up 2.3 percent in the wake of a spate of positive earnings from other chipmakers. DR Horton Inc's quarterly results fell short of analyst expectations, underscoring persistent weakness in the U.S. housing market. The homebuilder's shares dropped 4.3 percent. Western Digital Corp also disappointed, but its shares rose 6.9 percent after providing an upbeat forecast and saying it was committed to paying dividends.

The action by noyb, chaired by data privacy activist Max Schrems, also named Netflix ( ), Spotify ( ) and YouTube ( ), after it tested them by requesting private data the companies hold about the user. “No service fully complied,” noyb said in its statement. The GDPR, implemented in May, gives users the right to access their data and information about the sources and recipients of the data. Social networks must regain Europeans’ consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4 percent of global revenues for companies that break the rules. In response to the complaint, Amazon said it has introduced a new “Privacy Help” page which shows customers how they can manage their information across its platforms. “We comply with any request from a data subject to provide access to the personal data that Amazon is processing,” Amazon said on Friday. A spokeswoman for Spotify said: “We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant.” Noyb said it filed its complaints with the Austrian authority on behalf of 10 users. The Austrian watchdog would have to work with its counterparts at the streaming services’ main establishments. “Many services set up automated systems to respond to access requests, but they often don’t even remotely provide the data that every user has a right to,” Schrems said. “This leads to structural violations of users’ rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information.” Schrems is a veteran privacy campaigner who took his first legal action against Facebook ( ) as a student in 2011. Now a lawyer, Schrems filed complaints last year against Google, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing they were acting illegally by forcing users to accept intrusive terms of service or lose access.",AAPL

Last week, the Nikkei reported that Foxconn had let go around 50,000 contract workers in China since October, months earlier than normal. The Nikkei report came weeks after Apple cut current-quarter production for new iPhones by 10 percent in the face of slowing demand in China, the world’s largest smartphone market.

The new Honor View20, launched in China in December, was presented in Paris on Tuesday. The phone has a 48 mega pixel camera that can take several pictures at once and combine the best qualities from each in a single photo. It also has a second camera that can take 3D pictures and a 25 mega pixel in-screen front camera for selfies. The smartphone starts at 549 euros ($624). The appeal of Honor - a sub-brand in Huawei’s smartphone portfolio - is that it has many of the advanced features of the company’s premium line of Huawei-brand phones at significantly lower cost. “They’re really trying to build up the brand in Europe,” said Annette Zimmermann, an analyst at Gartner. She said Honor started as a cheaper alternative to Huawei’s more expensive smartphones, but that the firm was now gradually increasing the prices for the Honor brand. Europe has become the second-biggest market for Huawei, making it a major region for further international expansion as the company also tries to bolster its presence in the United States. Huawei overtook Apple to become the world’s second-biggest smartphone seller after Samsung last year. The Chinese company had a market share of 13.4 percent worldwide in the third quarter last year, compared with 18.9 percent for Samsung and 11.8 percent for Apple, according to Gartner.",AAPL

The new Honor View20, launched in China in December, was presented in Paris on Tuesday. The phone has a 48 mega pixel camera that can take several pictures at once and combine the best qualities from each in a single photo. It also has a second camera that can take 3D pictures and a 25 mega pixel in-screen front camera for selfies. The smartphone starts at 549 euros ($624).

She said Honor started as a cheaper alternative to Huawei’s more expensive smartphones, but that the firm was now gradually increasing the prices for the Honor brand.

The social media platform is investing billions of dollars a year to improve the security of its network, Sandberg said in an interview hosted by German newspaper Die Zeit and UK law firm CMS at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “We did not anticipate all of the risks from connecting so many people,” Sandberg said, adding that the site had added features that give users greater control over their personal information. The 15-year-old technology company has been a darling of California’s Silicon Valley, making stars out of its founder, chief executive and chairman Mark Zuckerberg, and Sandberg, known for her feminist manifesto “Lean In”. But its shares have fallen roughly 33 percent since July to $144 due to concerns about user privacy. Last year, the company was buffeted by revelations that UK consultancy Cambridge Analytica had improperly acquired data on millions of its U.S. users to target election advertising. “We need to earn back trust,” Sandberg said. Some of Facebook’s major shareholders have pushed for Zuckerberg, who has majority control of the company, to step down as chairman. Sandberg said he should remain both chair and CEO. She said that she also plans to remain at Facebook, where she has worked since 2008. “I think I have a job to do,” she said. “It’s a job I really want to do.” Sandberg said that if Facebook had to change its business model and charge users a subscription fee instead of collecting advertising revenue, far fewer people would be able to use it. “Fundamentally disallowing our business model would harm a lot of people all over the world.” She said her grassroots women’s movement, spurred by the publication of “Lean In”, was still going strong.

The three services will, however, continue as stand-alone apps, the report said, citing four people involved in the effort. Facebook said it is working on adding end-to-end encryption, which protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the participants in a conversation, to more of its messaging products, and considering ways to make it easier for users to connect across networks. “There is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work,” a spokesperson said. After the changes, a Facebook user, for instance, will be able send an encrypted message to someone who has only a WhatsApp account, according to the New York Times report. Integrating the messaging services could make it harder for antitrust regulators to break up Facebook by undoing its acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram, said Sam Weinstein, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. “If Facebook is worried about that then one way it can defend itself is to integrate those services,” Weinstein said. But Weinstein said breaking up Facebook is viewed as an “extreme remedy” by regulators, particularly in the United States, so concerns over antitrust scrutiny may not have been a factor behind the integration. Some former Facebook security engineers and an outside encryption expert said the plan could be good news for user privacy, in particular by extending end-to-end encryption. “I’m cautiously optimistic it’s a good thing,” said former Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, who now teaches at Stanford University. “My fear was that they were going to drop end-to-end encryption.” However, the technology does not always conceal metadata - information about who is talking to whom - sparking concern among some researchers that the data might be shared. Any metadata integration likely will let Facebook learn more about users, linking identifiers such as phone numbers and email addresses for those using the services independently of each other. Facebook could use that data to charge more for advertising and targeted services, although it also would have to forgo ads based on message content in Messenger and Instagram. Other major tradeoffs will have to be made too, Stamos and others said. Messenger allows strangers to contact people without knowing their phone numbers, for example, increasing the risk of stalking and approaches to children. Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. “It should be an open process, because you can’t have it all,” Stamos said.",FB

Systems based on phone numbers have additional privacy concerns, because governments and other entities can easily extract location information from them. Stamos said he hoped Facebook would get public input from terrorism experts, child safety officers, privacy advocates and others and be transparent in its reasoning when it makes decisions on the details. “It should be an open process, because you can’t have it all,” Stamos said.",FB

Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon’s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips. Amazon’s so-called “Inferentia” chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests. The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia’s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer. Intel’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel. In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton.

Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon’s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips. Amazon’s so-called “Inferentia” chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests. The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia’s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer. Intel’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel. In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel’s dominance in that market. Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips.

Amazon is one of the largest buyers of chips from Intel and Nvidia, whose semiconductors help power Amazon’s booming cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services. But Amazon has started to design its own chips. Amazon’s so-called “Inferentia” chip announced on Wednesday will help with what researchers call inference, which is the process of taking an artificial intelligence algorithm and putting it to use, for example by scanning incoming audio and translating that into text-based requests. The Amazon chip is not a direct threat to Intel and Nvidia’s business because it will not be selling the chips. Amazon will sell services to its cloud customers that run atop the chips starting next year. If Amazon relies on its own chips, it could deprive both Nvidia and Intel of a major customer. Intel’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar believe will be worth $11.8 billion by 2021. [nL1N1V801B] In September, Nvidia launched its own inference chip to compete with Intel. In addition to its machine learning chip, Amazon on Monday announced a processor chip for its cloud unit called Graviton. That chip is powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Arm-based chips currently power mobile phones, but multiple companies are trying to make them suitable for data centers. [nL2N1W402B] The use of Arm chips in data centers potentially represents a major challenge to Intel’s dominance in that market. Amazon is not alone among cloud computing vendors in designing its own chips. Alphabet Inc-owned Google’s cloud unit in 2016 unveiled an artificial intelligence chip designed to take on chips from Nvidia. Custom chips can be expensive to design and produce, and analysts have pointed to such investment driving up research and capital expenses for big tech companies. Google Cloud executives have said customer demand for Google’s custom chip, the TPU, has been strong. But the chips can be costly to use and require software customization. Google Cloud charges $8 per hour of access to its TPU chips and as much as $2.48 per hour in the United States for access to Nvidia’s chips, according to Google’s website.",NVDA

Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su, during a keynote address at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, gave a preview of AMD’s third-generation Ryzen CPU chips for desktop users. The Ryzen CPU chips will be launched in the middle of this year and will compete with Intel’s PC processors. AMD will start shipping its Radeon VII (seven) graphics chips, which compete with Nvidia’s gaming chips, from Feb. 7 and the next generation of EPYC server chips in mid-2019, Su said. All the three chips are based on AMD’s partners’ new 7nm manufacturing technology that packs more transistors on smaller chips and can boost performance at lower power. AMD’s longtime manufacturing partner Global Foundries last year said it would quit trying to develop such advanced manufacturing techniques on its own, and AMD said it would move all of its 7-nanometer production to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which analysts also believe is making 7nm chips for Apple Inc. AMD’s EPYC server chips and the Ryzen CPU chips are based on Zen 2 architecture, an advancement over its Zen chips that was launched in 2017, establishing the chipmaker as an equal, if not better than Intel in terms of chip performance, according to many tech websites. For Intel, which has faced production delays for its 10nm-based chips, this could mean a loss of market share to AMD, analysts have said. Intel has said it expects to ship 10nm PC chips later this year and 10nm server chips early next year. During the keynote, Su showed that Ryzen III consumed 30 percent less power than Intel’s Core i9 CPU chip. Intel, the world’s biggest maker of computing chips for personal computers and data centers, has been a leader in manufacturing the tiniest chips so far but recently lost its title to Taiwan Semiconductor. Su also announced that Alphabet Inc’s Google was partnering to use AMD’s Radeon graphics chips on its recently announced video game streaming service, Project Stream.",NVDA

The 30,000-square-foot caffeinated wonderland represents just one of 6,000, mostly smaller stores the chain plans to roll out across the mainland by 2022. Such bold plans will run up against stiffer competition and trade-war-related pressures in 2019. Local backers will help preserve this fledgling Bean Dynasty. Cracking China has been tough for outsiders, including in fast food. McDonald’s sold a controlling stake in its Greater China restaurants to state-owned conglomerate CITIC in 2017. And as part of a wholesale spinoff of Yum China, the U.S. parent of KFC and Taco Bell offloaded a slug of the operation to Fred Hu’s Primavera Capital and Jack Ma’s Ant Financial. For now, Starbucks is touting its independent growth ambitions in the People’s Republic. At a full-day presentation focused on the country in May, it forecast tripling revenue there in five years. The company doesn’t break out China figures, but Morningstar estimates by then the top line would reach $6 billion, generating some $1.2 billion in operating profit, or nearly a fifth of the total for both. Investors don’t yet seem convinced. As of mid-December, Starbucks was trading at almost 24 times anticipated earnings for the next 12 months, a discount to recent historical levels. And the hefty premium it has fetched over the Golden Arches for much of the last decade has mostly vanished. That suggests Chief Executive Kevin Johnson isn’t getting credit for his great leap into China. There are valid reasons to be sceptical. Homegrown startups such as Luckin Coffee are expanding rapidly with the help of deep-pocketed backers. American brands are also in perpetual danger of getting swept up by geopolitical headwinds. Mergers have been caught in the crossfire, and targeted economic retaliation is a weapon China has used before. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz’s dream of becoming U.S. president remains a distant hedge. Stronger financial ties with well-connected allies, beyond just collaborations like the one with Alibaba for deliveries, could provide some insurance, as well as useful local knowhow as Starbucks extends deeper into the country. It recently bought out its Taiwanese partners in an East China joint venture, clearing the way for a venti-size deal to start brewing. - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019.

The firm, which only officially launched its business at the start of last year, has expanded at breakneck speed, propelled by a focus on technology, delivery, and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses. “What we want at the moment is scale and speed,” Luckin’s chief marketing officer, Yang Fei, told reporters on Thursday at a presentation in Beijing. “There’s no point talking about profit,” he said, adding that subsidies to lure in more users would be an important part of the firm’s strategy for the next few years. Luckin said it was targeting a total of more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, which would take it past Seattle-based Starbucks that has long dominated China’s coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country. Luckin’s caffeine-fuelled expansion is in stark contrast to Starbucks, which opened its first China store in 1999 and has spent two decades reaching its current store count. The U.S. chain, which spearheaded the growth of a coffee culture in China, started to see competition rise from smaller peers over the last 18 months, though Luckin has stood out as the most aggressive competitor. But Luckin’s rise has not come cheaply. The firm recorded a loss of 800 million yuan ($116.34 million) last year, which its chief marketing officer said was in line with expectations as it pushed to expand.

The world’s largest coffee chain said it listened to customers and brought back its much loved red-colored cups and holiday favorites such as Peppermint Mochas and Gingerbread Lattes during the final three months of 2018. “This comprehensive, insight-driven approach delivered results and importantly, created momentum that provides a solid foundation for future quarters,” Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said on a conference call with analysts. The Seattle-headquartered company, which is battling high-end coffee houses and smaller upstarts in the United States, has rolled out promotions, especially during slow afternoons to pull in more customers. Iced beverages and its Draft Nitro cold brew which aims to create a beer-like experience have been particularly successful, and the company said its morning and afternoon sales in the December-quarter was the best in five quarters. Partnerships with food-delivery companies and an increased focus on customer service through its mobile app are also helping boost sales, Starbucks executives said. Globally, the company’s same-restaurant sales rose 4 percent during the December-quarter, topping analysts’ average estimate of a 2.8 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Overall, we believe it was a solid quarter and this is another quarter that reinforces our view that the turnaround is showing progress and gaining some steam,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Sales from Starbucks’ Americas and U.S. business reached a record $4.6 billion in the three months ended Dec. 30, while same-restaurant sales in China, its second biggest market, also showed an increase.

Sales from Starbucks’ Americas and U.S. business reached a record $4.6 billion in the three months ended Dec. 30, while same-restaurant sales in China, its second biggest market, also showed an increase. In China, where the company competes with local brands like Luckin Coffee, sales at established Starbucks cafes beat estimates, driven mainly by new store openings and its delivery program that now supports 2,000 stores across 30 Chinese cities.

14,Pei Li,Coffee startup Luckin plans to overtake Starbucks in China this year | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coffee-luckin/coffee-startup-luckin-plans-to-overtake-starbucks-in-china-this-year-idUSKCN1OX0BY,https://www.reuters.com/,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese coffee startup Luckin is aiming to open 2,500 new stores this year and overtake Starbucks Corp ( ) as the largest coffee chain by number of outlets in the world’s second-biggest economy, it said on Thursday. The firm, which only officially launched its business at the start of last year, has expanded at breakneck speed, propelled by a focus on technology, delivery, and heavy discounting even at the cost of mounting losses. “What we want at the moment is scale and speed,” Luckin’s chief marketing officer, Yang Fei, told reporters on Thursday at a presentation in Beijing. “There’s no point talking about profit,” he said, adding that subsidies to lure in more users would be an important part of the firm’s strategy for the next few years. Luckin said it was targeting a total of more than 4,500 stores by the end of 2019, which would take it past Seattle-based Starbucks that has long dominated China’s coffee scene and has over 3,600 stores in the country. Luckin’s caffeine-fuelled expansion is in stark contrast to Starbucks, which opened its first China store in 1999 and has spent two decades reaching its current store count. The U.S. chain, which spearheaded the growth of a coffee culture in China, started to see competition rise from smaller peers over the last 18 months, though Luckin has stood out as the most aggressive competitor. But Luckin’s rise has not come cheaply. The firm recorded a loss of 800 million yuan ($116.34 million) last year, which its chief marketing officer said was in line with expectations as it pushed to expand. Luckin, backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd and China International Capital Corp Ltd ( ), opened more than 2,000 locations in the last year, gaining a valuation of $2.2 billion after raising $200 million in a funding round last month. The firm’s chief executive, Qian Zhiya, told Reuters last year that Luckin aimed to outnumber Starbucks in China. Reuters previously reported that Luckin was also in early-stage talks with investment banks about an overseas initial public offering. The firm, however, declined to answer questions about IPO plans on Thursday.",SBUX

18,Jeffrey Goldfarb,Breakingviews - Starbucks will start brewing a venti Chinese deal | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-starbucks-breakingviews/breakingviews-starbucks-will-start-brewing-a-venti-chinese-deal-idUSKCN1OX04J,https://www.reuters.com/,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Shanghai stands as a hulking symbol of the company’s Chinese ambitions. The 30,000-square-foot caffeinated wonderland represents just one of 6,000, mostly smaller stores the chain plans to roll out across the mainland by 2022. Such bold plans will run up against stiffer competition and trade-war-related pressures in 2019. Local backers will help preserve this fledgling Bean Dynasty. Cracking China has been tough for outsiders, including in fast food. McDonald’s sold a controlling stake in its Greater China restaurants to state-owned conglomerate CITIC in 2017. And as part of a wholesale spinoff of Yum China, the U.S. parent of KFC and Taco Bell offloaded a slug of the operation to Fred Hu’s Primavera Capital and Jack Ma’s Ant Financial. For now, Starbucks is touting its independent growth ambitions in the People’s Republic. At a full-day presentation focused on the country in May, it forecast tripling revenue there in five years. The company doesn’t break out China figures, but Morningstar estimates by then the top line would reach $6 billion, generating some $1.2 billion in operating profit, or nearly a fifth of the total for both. Investors don’t yet seem convinced. As of mid-December, Starbucks was trading at almost 24 times anticipated earnings for the next 12 months, a discount to recent historical levels. And the hefty premium it has fetched over the Golden Arches for much of the last decade has mostly vanished. That suggests Chief Executive Kevin Johnson isn’t getting credit for his great leap into China. There are valid reasons to be sceptical. Homegrown startups such as Luckin Coffee are expanding rapidly with the help of deep-pocketed backers. American brands are also in perpetual danger of getting swept up by geopolitical headwinds. Mergers have been caught in the crossfire, and targeted economic retaliation is a weapon China has used before. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz’s dream of becoming U.S. president remains a distant hedge. Stronger financial ties with well-connected allies, beyond just collaborations like the one with Alibaba for deliveries, could provide some insurance, as well as useful local knowhow as Starbucks extends deeper into the country. It recently bought out its Taiwanese partners in an East China joint venture, clearing the way for a venti-size deal to start brewing. - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019.

20,Nivedita Balu,Starbucks top sales forecasts as holiday drinks make comeback | Reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-starbucks-results/starbucks-top-sales-forecasts-as-holiday-drinks-make-comeback-idUSKCN1PI30C,https://www.reuters.com/,"(Reuters) - Starbucks exceeded Wall Street forecasts for quarterly sales on Thursday, led by the popularity of its holiday-themed drinks in the United States, where its growth has been cooling in an increasingly crowded market for coffee houses. The world’s largest coffee chain said it listened to customers and brought back its much loved red-colored cups and holiday favorites such as Peppermint Mochas and Gingerbread Lattes during the final three months of 2018. “This comprehensive, insight-driven approach delivered results and importantly, created momentum that provides a solid foundation for future quarters,” Starbucks Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said on a conference call with analysts. The Seattle-headquartered company, which is battling high-end coffee houses and smaller upstarts in the United States, has rolled out promotions, especially during slow afternoons to pull in more customers. Iced beverages and its Draft Nitro cold brew which aims to create a beer-like experience have been particularly successful, and the company said its morning and afternoon sales in the December-quarter was the best in five quarters. Partnerships with food-delivery companies and an increased focus on customer service through its mobile app are also helping boost sales, Starbucks executives said. Globally, the company’s same-restaurant sales rose 4 percent during the December-quarter, topping analysts’ average estimate of a 2.8 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Overall, we believe it was a solid quarter and this is another quarter that reinforces our view that the turnaround is showing progress and gaining some steam,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.
